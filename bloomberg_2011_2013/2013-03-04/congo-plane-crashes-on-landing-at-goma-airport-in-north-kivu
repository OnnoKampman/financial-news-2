A Congolese airplane attempting to
land during a rainstorm crashed in the eastern city of Goma,
carrying at least nine people, according to the airline.  Five crew members and four passengers were on board the
Compagnie Africaine d’Aviation Fokker 50 when it took off from
Lodja, about 400 miles (643 kilometers) west of Goma in Western
Kasai province, said Pasteur Emile, CAA’s station manager in the
town.  “It crashed in the middle of the city, but luckily it
crashed in an empty lot,” Julien Paluku, governor of North Kivu
province, said by phone. The plane was two minutes from landing
and three survivors were pulled from the wreckage, he said.  Earlier, United Nations-backed Radio Okapi said 30 people
were on board, without saying how it got the information. The
Fokker 50 can carry as many as 58 passengers, according to CAA’s
website.  Congolese airlines, including CAA, are banned from flying
within  Europe . In April 2008 a Hewa Bora Airways plane crashed
on takeoff in Goma, killing 37 people on the ground and three on
the plane. In July 2011, at least 83 people were killed when a
Hewa Bora plane crashed in Kisangani. CAA flies to 34
destinations in Congo, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
