The  Dallas Mavericks  are one win away
from the National Basketball Association Finals after erasing a
15-point fourth-quarter deficit and defeating the  Oklahoma City 
Thunder 112-105 in overtime.  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 40 points to lead the Mavericks, who
forced overtime with a 17-2 scoring run over the final 4:48 of
regulation play last night at Oklahoma City Arena.  Dallas , which had trailed 99-84, then outscored the Thunder
11-4 in the five-minute overtime to take a 3-1 lead in the best-
of-seven Western Conference finals. The Mavericks can reach the
NBA Finals with a Game 5 win tomorrow in Dallas.  “We’re happy with this win, but it’s not over yet,”
Nowitzki, who hit 12 of 20 shots and 14 of 15 free throws, said
in a televised interview.  The Mavericks are 6-1 at home this postseason and have also
won five straight road playoff games as they pursue their first
NBA championship. Dallas has made 11 consecutive playoff
appearances since billionaire  Mark Cuban  bought the team in
2000, getting as far as the NBA Finals in 2006 before losing to
the  Miami Heat .  “The thing about this team all year is it’s been a
resourceful group,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said during a
news conference. “They keep believing and we’ve been extremely
opportunistic. The way they hung in tonight was fantastic.”  The Western Conference champion will face the Heat or
Chicago Bulls for the NBA title.  Heat Lead Bulls  The Heat hold a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference finals
with Game 4 scheduled for tonight in Miami, where  LeBron James ,
 Dwyane Wade  and the Heat have a 7-0 record this postseason.  The Mavericks trailed by 12 points in the first quarter
last night and didn’t lead during regulation play.  Nowitzki scored 12 points, including two free throws with
6.4 seconds remaining, to tie the game at 101 and force
overtime.  “We kept believing,” Nowitzki said. “In the last couple
minutes we got some great stops. We finally got rebounds and it
helped us with our flow.”  With the score tied and 40 seconds left in overtime, Jason Kidd hit a three-pointer to put Dallas up 108-105. The
Mavericks, who got 20 points from Jason Terry and 17 from Kidd,
then sealed the win from the free throw line.  Kevin Durant  led the Thunder with 29 points and 15
rebounds, yet also had nine turnovers. Russell Westbrook added
19 points while Serge Ibaka had 18 points and 10 rebounds.  Oklahoma City’s youth and postseason inexperience didn’t
cause the fourth-quarter collapse, Durant said. The Thunder’s
top four playoff scorers are 22 years old or younger, while the
Mavericks’ three leading scorers are 32 and 33.  Oklahoma City missed 13 of 16 shots during the final five
minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime.  “We had a couple turnovers, a couple quick shots and we
missed some shots. We also had two bad fouls. Was that youth? I
don’t know,” Thunder coach Scott Brooks said at a news
conference. “We’ve had some success all year playing with a
young team. We have to execute better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
