The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.4 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York , posting its second-best gain of the year and rebounding from the biggest drop in five months.

Slideshow:  Best and Worst Investments of 2012 Gold recovered from a two-year low after the biggest selloff since 1980 as investors including BlackRock Inc.’s Catherine Raw and Sri Lankan central bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said the decline led to a buying opportunity. Coca-Cola reported higher sales volumes in  Latin America , while new drugs helped J&J beat projections. U.S. housing starts jumped as multifamily projects rose to the highest level in more than seven years, while cheaper gasoline led to a drop in consumer prices.  “The outlook for gold for us is really positive in the long term,” Raw, a  fund manager  in  London  at BlackRock, which oversees about $3.8 trillion globally, said in an interview today on Bloomberg Television with Francine Lacqua. “The probability of inflation over the next five years is higher not lower than it was last year. Other things such as cash losing money, the Cyprus event, savings being targeted means people are looking for alternatives.”  IMF Forecasts  Stocks rebounded even after the  International Monetary Fund  trimmed its global growth forecast and urged European policy makers to use “aggressive” monetary policy as a second year of contraction leaves the euro area’s recovery lagging behind the rest of the world.  The global economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, less than the 3.5 percent forecast in January, after 3.2 percent growth in 2012, the IMF said, cutting its prediction for this year a fourth consecutive time. The IMF sees the 17-country euro area shrinking 0.3 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent retreat in January, with  France  joining Spain and  Italy  in contracting.  Gold Watch  Gold for June delivery pared gains after climbing as much as 3.2 percent to $1,404.20 an ounce. Futures sank 13 percent in the previous two days. The drop was triggered by speculation that Cyprus would sell its  gold reserves , leading other European central banks to follow suit, Goldman Sachs said in a report today.

West Texas Intermediate oil was little changed before a report that may show a U.S. supply gain.  Boston Explosions  Gauges of commodity, technology, financial and consumer- staples companies rose at least 1.5 percent to lead the rebound today after the  S&P 500  sank 2.3 percent yesterday. The index extended losses late yesterday as explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon killed three people and left at least 128 in the hospital.  Coca-Cola rose 5.7 percent, the most in four years, and reached an almost 15-year high after profit topped estimates and the company announced a deal to sell some bottling distribution rights.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. retreated 1.6 percent after the Wall Street bank that generates the highest percentage of its top line from trading reported revenue from that business fell more than its rivals.

His firm has $2.08 trillion in client assets. “People on the sidelines are waiting for a pullback to get into the market that they’ve missed for the past six months. We’re seeing more of that today.”  Housing starts climbed 7 percent to a 1.04 million annual rate, the most since June 2008, following a revised 968,000 annual rate in February that was larger than previously reported, according to Commerce Department figures. The median estimate of 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 930,000. Another report showed industrial production increased 0.4 percent, twice as much as forecast.  Inflation Data  The cost of living in the U.S. declined in March for the first time in four months as cheaper gasoline and clothing kept inflation in check.
