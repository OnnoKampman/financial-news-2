Following is a translation of the
statement by Brazil’s central bank on its  interest rate  decision
today.  “Giving continuation to the adjustment of the benchmark
interest rate, the Copom decided unanimously to raise the Selic
rate to 9 percent a year, without bias.  The committee considers that this decision will contribute
to put inflation on a decline and assure that this trend will
persist next year.  The following board members voted for this decision:
President Alexandre Antonio Tombini, Aldo Luiz Mendes,  Altamir Lopes , Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Hamilton Vasconcelos Araujo, Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, Luiz Edson Feltrim and
Sidnei Correa Marques.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
