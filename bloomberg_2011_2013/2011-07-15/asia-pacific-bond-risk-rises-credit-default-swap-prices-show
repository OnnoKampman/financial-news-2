The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment rose in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 2 basis points
to 122 basis points as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices show. That’s on track for the highest
level since Sept. 1, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 120.5 as of 8:30
a.m. in Singapore, RBS prices show. The Markit iTraxx Japan
index fell 0.5 basis point to 125.5 as of 9:38 a.m. in Tokyo,
Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
