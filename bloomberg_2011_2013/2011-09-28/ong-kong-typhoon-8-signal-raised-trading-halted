Nesat was downgraded to a tropical
storm yesterday as it moved west into northern  Vietnam  after
battering southern China with gale force winds and torrential
rain.  The storm made land in northern Vietnam’s Quang Ninh
province at 11:30 a.m. Beijing time, with winds as fast as 108
kilometers (67 miles) an hour, the China Meteorological
Administration said. Nesat damaged 300 houses, sunk 11 boats,
flooded 1,600 hectares of rice fields and prompted the
evacuation of 2,000 people in Vietnam, Xinhua said, citing local
authorities. No casualties were reported, and damage during the
first three hours was estimated at $2.4 million, the agency
said.  As it swept past Hong Kong Sept. 29, Nesat felled trees,
ripped bamboo scaffolding from buildings and forced the city’s
stock exchange to shut. It then slammed into the Chinese island
province of Hainan with typhoon winds as fast as 151 kilometers
an hour, forcing the evacuation of 450,000 people and causing
5.8 billion yuan ($909 million) of damage,  China ’s official
Xinhua News Agency said.  Nesat was the strongest typhoon to hit China this year and
the strongest to strike Hainan province in six years, according
to the  Chinese weather agency . Authorities in Hainan ordered
ships back to port, canceled ferry services and halted flights
and high-speed rail services Sept. 29 ahead of the storm’s
arrival. Nesat, after hitting Hainan at 2:30 p.m. local time
Sept. 29, made land at 9:15 p.m. in Guangdong, according to
Xinhua.  National Holiday  Some train services in Hainan resumed yesterday afternoon
and airports in the cities of Sanya and Haikou returned to
normal,  China Central Television  reported yesterday. More than
20,000 travelers in Hainan were affected by the storm, the state
broadcaster reported.  Nesat hit the tropical province, home to resort cities such
as Sanya, two days ahead of the weeklong National Day holidays
that start today.  In  Hong Kong , trading on the city’s stock exchange resumed
yesterday, while most public transportation in the city had
restarted by the evening of Sept. 29. All flights were normal
yesterday.  The city has endured fewer tropical storms in the past two
years, with seven in 2011 and 11 the previous year, compared
with 28 in 2009. Typhoon Muifa caused almost 3 billion yuan
($469 million) of direct economic losses in China in August,
according to Xinhua.  The Philippines yesterday raised the lowest of its weather
bureau’s four-scale storm alerts in the provinces of Cagayan,
Isabela and the Babuyan Group of Islands ahead of Typhoon

province in the main island of Luzon as of 4 a.m. local time,
with maximum winds of 130 kilometers per hour.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
