Christine Lagarde , French finance
minister and a candidate to head the  International Monetary
Fund , said her conscience is “at ease” awaiting a court’s
decision on whether to investigate her for abuse of power.  Lagarde, speaking on Europe 1 radio today, defended her
decision to arbitrate a dispute with Bernard Tapie, a supporter
of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and not to appeal the
panel’s 385 million-euro ($551 million) award to Tapie, saying
it was in the state’s interest to end the 15-year-old dispute.  When she arrived at the  Finance Ministry , Lagarde studied
the most recent decision in the Tapie file by France’s highest
appeals court, concluding the state faced “a potential risk of
as much as 7 billion euros,” she told Europe 1. She said she
saw three options: go back to court, negotiate a settlement or
enter arbitration, which she chose “so that we could close it
in the least negative way for the state.”  Lagarde also criticized the prosecution report recommending
the court overseeing ministers’ conduct in office investigate
the matter, saying that when it said she decided to arbitrate
the affair, she was Minister of Agriculture.  The IMF plans to pick a new head by the end of June.
Lagarde will fly to  Brazil  tonight for a one-day visit to
bolster support for her candidacy. Brazil was “the first to
tell me to come” of the countries she contacted, she told
Europe 1. She contacted “certain African countries,” China and
 India  as well, and said she will probably visit the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
