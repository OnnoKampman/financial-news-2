Corn extended a decline to a 34-month
low as cool weather and moist soil increase yield prospects in
the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter. Wheat dropped
to the lowest since June 2012, and soybeans fell.  Near-to-below-normal temperatures in the Midwest in the
first half of August will favor corn pollination, while moisture
will stay favorable in southern and eastern areas, DTN wrote in
a forecast today. Farmers may harvest a record 13.95 billion
bushels, 29 percent more than last year, when drought hurt
crops, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “We have another week of cool temperatures ahead, and some
rains are going to hit the Corn Belt now through Wednesday,”
 Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
 Illinois , said by telephone. “We do want some warmth to show
up, maybe starting in late August or September, but that’s
taking a back seat to this cool weather.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
settle at $4.605 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after touching $4.56, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 4, 2010. The grain retreated 6.3 percent in
July, the sixth straight drop and the worst run since 1996.  Production will top the USDA’s forecast, rising to 14.269
billion bushels in 2013, researcher Doane Advisory Services Co.
in  St. Louis  said Aug. 2. Doane’s August corn estimate last year
was among the most-accurate.  Wheat futures for September delivery declined 2.3 percent
to $6.4525 a bushel on the CBOT. The price earlier touched
$6.415, the lowest since June 18, 2012, on speculation that
livestock producers will switch back to corn in animal rations
as the price spread between the grains widens.  High Premium  Wheat on Aug. 2 was $1.9675 a bushel more expensive than
corn futures, the most since February 2011. Wheat prices will
decline as demand by feedlot manager drops, said Mike Zuzolo,
the president of Global Commodity Analytics in Lafayette,
 Indiana .  “Wheat doesn’t work into the blending” for  animal feed 
because its premium to corn is too high, Zuzolo said by
telephone. “That wheat-corn spread will shut off the spigot of
wheat feeding.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$11.8325 a bushel in Chicago. The price is down 16 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
