Oil edged higher in New York and
surged the most in almost two weeks in  London  amid speculation
that an increase in OPEC production quotas will reduce spare
capacity and cause tight supplies when demand rebounds.  New York futures climbed 8 cents, erasing declines in the
last 90 seconds of trading. Brent gained more than $2 a barrel
after a Gulf delegate with knowledge of the matter said OPEC
members agree on the need to raise output. The U.S. raised its
forecast for global oil consumption for this year.  “Adding more crude to the system isn’t making a difference
because it’s not crude we need or are going to use,” said Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and research with Blue
Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York . “They’re taking away barrels
from the spare capacity from the back end and that’s making it
bullish rather than bearish.”  Crude for July delivery settled at $99.09 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , the first gain in three days.
Earlier, the contract touched $97.74, the lowest intraday price
since May 24. Oil is up 39 percent in the past year.  Prices advanced from the settlement after the  American
Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles decreased 5.51 million barrels to 366.1 million. July
oil rose 57 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $99.58 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  Brent crude  for July delivery gained $2.30, or 2 percent,
to $116.78 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. It was the biggest increase since May 25.  Brent’s premium to New York futures was $17.69 a barrel.
Earlier today, it widened to a record $17.91. The difference
between the front-month contracts in London and New York
averaged 63 cents last year.  Brent Rises  Brent has advanced 23 percent this year as unrest in the
 Middle East  and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia and
 Egypt  and spread to Libya. The fighting in Libya has removed
about 1.5 million barrels a day of oil output from the market.  West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has
gained 8.4 percent during the same period amid a glut of supply
at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for the New York
contract. Cushing supplies reached a record 41.9 million barrels
in the week ended April 8, according to the Energy Department.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
producing 2 million barrels a day above its official ceiling,
the delegate said, declining to be named because he isn’t
authorized to speak publicly. An increase in the output targets
would help replace missing supplies from  Libya  and meet demand-
growth projections for later this year.  OPEC ministers are scheduled to meet tomorrow in Vienna.  Spare Capacity  OPEC had 5.94 million barrels a day in spare capacity in
May, down 2.7 percent from April, based on Bloomberg estimates.
Spare capacity was 6.31 million barrels a day in March, the
highest level since May 2009.  The U.S. Energy Department raised its forecast for global
oil consumption for this year to 88.43 million barrels a day
from 88.08 million in May, according to its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook , released today. It cut its oil-price forecast to
an average $101.91 for 2011 from $102.67 last month.  OPEC will likely increase production quotas by 1.5 million
barrels a day, analysts from Societe Generale SA and Morgan
Stanley said in reports today. That would be about a quarter of
the group’s spare capacity, based on Bloomberg estimates.  The forecast OPEC increase is likely to come from actual
production, according to the note by Societe Generale analysts
led by  Michael Wittner  in New York.  Supply Cuts  The producer group announced its biggest-ever supply cuts
in late 2008 amid a collapse in global demand, capping
production at 24.845 million barrels a day for all members
except  Iraq , which is exempt from the quota system. Its
compliance rate with those limits was 69 percent in April, OPEC
said in its monthly report on May 12.  Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said yesterday the
group is unlikely to raise output limits, as he arrived in the
Austrian capital.  OPEC’s decision tomorrow could be the “catalyst” that
causes New York futures to break out of their four-week range of
$95 to $105 a barrel,  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork
Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene .  If oil rises after the meeting, it’s likely to rebound to
above $106 a barrel and then target highs from early May of
almost $115 a barrel, he said. If OPEC’s decision is a
“surprise” that causes prices to drop below $95, it’s likely
to plummet through $90 and test $88.87 a barrel, Schork said.
Oil last traded that low in February.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 724,956
contracts as of 3:31 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 509,468
contracts yesterday, 23 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.51 million contracts, the
lowest level since March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
