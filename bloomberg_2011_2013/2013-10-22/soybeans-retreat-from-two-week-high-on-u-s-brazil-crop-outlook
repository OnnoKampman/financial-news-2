Soybean and corn futures dropped in
 Chicago  on speculation that dry weather will allow U.S. farmers
to expedite harvests that were delayed by late planting. Wheat
advanced.  Farmers  gathered  63 percent of  soybeans  and 39 percent of
the  corn  in the main growing areas as of Oct. 20, below the
five-year average, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. About 60 percent of corn was in good or excellent
condition, up from 55 percent on Sept. 29, while soybeans
improved to 57 percent from 53 percent, the government said.  “Dry weather this week will help farmers finish up soybean
harvesting in many areas and lead to more cash sales,” Chad Henderson, the president of Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc.
in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “The
improvement in crop ratings signals that we will have bigger
corn and soybean crops.”  Soybean futures for delivery in January slid 0.2 percent to
close at $12.975 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices reached $13.0125 yesterday, the highest since Oct.
10. U.S. soybean  production  may rise 4.4 percent to the highest
in three years, the USDA said Sept. 12.  Corn futures for delivery in December slumped 1.3 percent
to $4.3825 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest drop since Oct. 8.
The USDA predicted output will jump 28 percent to a record this
year, rebounding from a drought-damaged harvest in 2012.  USDA Schedule  The USDA is scheduled to update its U.S. and world supply
and demand estimates on Nov. 8 after this month’s report was
canceled due to a 16-day partial shutdown of the federal
government that started Oct. 1. Weekly crop-progress reports
weren’t published in that span.  Late-season rains boosted U.S. crops more than the
government said last month, R.J. O’Brien & Associates predicted
today. Corn production will rise to 13.91 billion bushels, above
the USDA forecast of 13.843 billion estimated Sept. 12, the
broker said in an e-mailed report to clients. Soybean output
will rise to 3.211 billion, above the government’s forecast of
3.149 billion.  Wheat futures for delivery in December rose 0.1 percent to
$7.0075 a bushel on the CBOT. Yesterday, the most-active
contract touched $7.1125, the highest since June 21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
