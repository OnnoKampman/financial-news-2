The following is the text of the
Federal Reserve Board’s Tenth District--  Kansas City .  TENTH DISTRICT - KANSAS CITY  The Tenth District economy expanded at a modest pace in late
November and December. Consumer spending softened, with weakness
in auto, restaurant, and tourism sales. District manufacturing
activity contracted slightly, though factory operators remained
optimistic about growth in the coming months. High-tech firms
reported continued strong growth, while transportation activity
was flat. Residential and commercial real estate conditions
remained broadly weak, but contacts expressed increased optimism
about sales and prices in the coming months. District banks
reported generally steady loan demand and improved loan quality.
High crude  oil prices  buoyed activity in the District’s energy
sector. Agricultural growing conditions improved, but higher
input and production costs constrained farm profits. Rising
input costs were reported in several sectors, but few District
contacts noted either hiring shortages or wage pressures.  Consumer Spending . Consumer spending softened in late November
and December, with a slowdown in the auto, restaurant, and
tourism sectors. Many District contacts attributed the weakness
in spending to ongoing regulatory and political uncertainty.
Most retailers, however, expected spending to rise over the next
three months. Following several months of strong activity, auto
dealers reported a dip in sales with slower sales expected in
coming months. Auto inventories increased over the previous
survey period, and most dealers reported satisfaction with
current levels. Restaurant sales were flat despite larger
average check amounts. However, restaurant contacts expected
sales to rebound over the next three months. Tourism activity
slowed, as winter storms hampered some tourist activity but
helped ski resorts. Hoteliers reported lower occupancy rates but
stable average room rates.  Manufacturing and Other Business Activity. Manufacturing
activity contracted slightly during the survey period, but
factory operators remained optimistic about the coming months.
Activity was broadly weaker, with production, shipments, and new
orders lower relative to the prior survey. The weakest sectors
were  food processing  and fabricated metals, while growth in
machinery and high-tech manufacturing remained strong. Order
backlogs, manufacturing employment, and average hours worked
declined. Despite weaker activity, expectations were positive
for the coming months for production, shipments, and orders.
Transportation firms reported mostly unchanged conditions as
activity remained well above year-ago levels. Most high-tech
services firms reported sales gains and increased capital
spending. Contacts in both the transportation and high-tech
sectors reported continued difficulty finding skilled workers.  Real Estate and Construction. Residential and commercial real
estate activity remained sluggish in late November and December.
District home prices were flat, but most real estate contacts
expected prices to rise along with home sales over the next
three months. Multiple contacts reported multi-family housing as
a source of strength in the housing market. Mortgage lenders
reported weak mortgage demand with fewer home purchases and
refinancings relative to the previous survey period. Lenders
cited stricter mortgage lending requirements as a key factor
underlying weak loan demand. Housing starts declined further,
and expectations about future construction activity remained
subdued. Construction supply firms reported weak sales over the
survey period, and most expected little change in activity over
the coming months. Commercial real estate sales, prices, and
vacancy rates improved, and District contacts were more
optimistic about the coming months. Rents on commercial
properties were stable and expected to rise over the next three
months. Developers reported little change in access to credit.  Banking. Almost all bankers reported generally steady loan
demand, stable or improving loan quality, and increased deposits.
Loan demand by category was mixed. Most respondents reported
steady loan demand for commercial and industrial loans,
commercial and residential real estate loans, and consumer
installment loans. Remaining respondents were split between
stronger and weaker demand within each of these categories.
Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan
categories and deposits increased for the eighth straight survey.
Bankers generally reported loan quality as steady or improving
compared to a year ago and reported the outlook for loan quality
over the next six months as steady or improving.  Agriculture. Agricultural growing conditions improved in late
November and December but farm income prospects dimmed with high
input costs. Timely rains eased drought conditions in the
Southern Plains. Most of the winter wheat crop emerged in good
condition, though more protective snow cover was needed for the
winter dormancy period. Volatile crop prices and high input
costs tempered crop profit expectations for the coming year.
High production costs trimmed margins for livestock operators
even though strong export demand underpinned prices. Still, with
historically high profits, many farmers were repaying operating
loans, buying farmland and purchasing additional machinery and
equipment. District contacts reported an increase in the number
of farmland auctions as record high land prices enticed more
landowners to sell.  Energy. District energy and mining contacts reported continued
strong activity in late November and December and remained
optimistic about the coming months. Drilling rig counts were
flat in most District states but remained well above year-ago
levels. Drilling continued to shift away from dry natural gas
and toward liquid-rich formations. However, crude exploration in
the Niobrara formation in  Wyoming  slowed as contacts reported
better opportunities in other areas. Producers expected stable
crude prices but relatively weak natural  gas prices  over the
next three months. Attracting qualified workers and finding
adequate equipment remained a concern for oil and gas contacts.
District coal production declined slightly in November and
December and remained below year-ago levels. A recent drop in
ethanol prices trimmed margins for ethanol producers despite
lower input costs and strong export demand.  Wages and Prices. District contacts reported higher prices for
both inputs and finished goods, but wage pressures remained
confined to select industries and occupations. Manufacturers
reported an uptick in input prices in late November and December,
but relatively few reported higher finished goods prices.
Manufacturers expected further price increases for both inputs
and finished goods in the coming months. Most restaurants
reported a continued rise in food costs and expected further
increases over the next three months. Retailers and
transportation firms increased prices in the latest survey
period, while construction suppliers reported falling prices due
to weak building demand. Few contacts outside of the energy,
high-tech, and transportation sectors reported either hiring
shortages or upward wage pressures, and most expected little
wage pressure in the coming months. Rising employee benefit
costs, particularly for health care, remained a concern for many
contacts.
