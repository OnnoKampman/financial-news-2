  Barclays Plc  raised its year-end
forecast for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to 1,450 from
1,420, saying the U.S. economic recovery is strong enough to
survive surging  oil prices .  Barry Knapp, the New York-based chief equity strategist for
the third-biggest U.K. bank, lifted his per-share profit
estimate for companies in the index this year to $93 from $91,
citing better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and
increasing confidence in the financial sector margins.  “We are more optimistic than we have been at this time in
each of the last two years,” Knapp wrote in a report dated Feb.
25. “The economy is in a ‘sweet spot’ of accommodative monetary
policy and faces an improving economic outlook that favors
cyclical sectors.”  The S&P 500 has advanced 5.7 percent this year as corporate
earnings beat Wall Street estimates for an eighth-straight
quarter and the  Federal Reserve  maintained a pledge to make $600
billion in asset purchases through June to boost the  U.S.
economy . The benchmark measure for U.S. stocks slid 1.7 percent
last week to 1,319.88 as anti-government uprisings in  Libya 
pushed oil prices higher and prompted concern economic growth
may falter.  Barclays raised its recommendation for industrial companies
to “overweight” and health-care and financial stocks to
“marketweight,” while lowering its rating of consumer
discretionary companies to “marketweight.” Large-scale asset
purchases are a tailwind for cyclical stocks, companies that are
closely tied to economic growth, and a headwind for defensives,
the London-based bank said.  “The market is currently struggling to quantify a new
exogenous risk, the political instability in the Middle East and
a related oil shock,” Knapp wrote. “However, given the
experience of the last decade, our current thinking is that the
shock will not be large enough to derail the recovery.”  The  S&P 500  rose 0.7 percent to 1,328.48 at 10:59 a.m. in
New York. Crude oil futures for April delivery rose 7 cents to
$97.95 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
