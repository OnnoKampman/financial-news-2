Treasuries (BUSY)  rose for a second week as
U.S. job growth below forecast for a third month added to
speculation the economic recovery is too slow for the  Federal
Reserve  to begin reducing asset purchases this year.  Treasury 10-year yields touched the lowest level since July
as additional reports showed  consumer confidence  fell for a
third month and durable-goods orders excluding transportation
unexpectedly declined, suggesting the economy took a step back
amid the fiscal gridlock that partially shut down the federal
government. The U.S. will sell $96 billion of notes next week
and Fed policy makers meet Oct. 29-30.  “As a result of both the government shutdown and the debt
ceiling, and the impact of those things on confidence, the
assumption will be to expect weaker numbers unless proven
otherwise,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in
New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “The Fed will delay its tapering.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.51 percent this week, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.5 percent debt due August
2023 rose 19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 29/32.  Yields touched 2.47 percent on Oct. 23, the least since
July 22. The 10-year note yield has fallen 50 basis points since
reaching 3.01 percent on Sept. 6.  Treasuries returned 0.6 percent in October through Oct. 24,
limiting their loss for 2013 to 1.85 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Securities in the  Corporate Bond (BUSC)  Index
returned 1.4 percent this month, trimming losses to 1.06 percent
for the year. The Bloomberg Global Developed  Sovereign Bond
Index (BGSV)  gained 1.5 percent this month, reducing its 2013 decline
to 1.9 percent.  ‘Contributed Mightily’  Payrolls grew by 148,000 last month, versus the median
forecast of a 180,000 advance by 93 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The Oct. 22 Labor Department report, delayed by the
16-day shutdown that ended on Oct. 17, was originally slated for
Oct. 4.  “Much of it has to do with expectations of the Fed
withdrawing its  influence  in the markets,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2.2 billion as chief investment officer
at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. That
“contributed mightily to more investment” in Treasuries,
Sullivan said.  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  refrained
from reducing the pace of its monthly securities purchases on
Sept. 18, with Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  saying the Fed must
determine its policies based on “what’s needed for the
economy,” even if it surprises markets.  Growth Constraint  The central bank will delay the first reduction in its bond
 purchases  until March after the government shutdown slowed
fourth-quarter growth, economists said. Policy makers will pare
the monthly pace of asset buying to $70 billion from $85 billion
at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the median of 40
responses in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The shutdown that began Oct. 1 probably trimmed 0.25
percentage point from fourth-quarter economic growth and cost
120,000 jobs in October, President  Barack Obama ’s chief economic
adviser said Oct. 22.  “I don’t see any real strength in the  economy ,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets
America Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“The earliest we’ll see tapering is in March. It wouldn’t
surprise me if that’s pushed out further because the economy is
going to go through a rough patch here.”  Traders are pricing in a 26.7 percent probability that the
Fed will raise its benchmark overnight rate by its January 2015
meeting, down from 37.1 percent a month ago.  Consumer Confidence  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment showed declined to 73.2 from 75.2 a month
earlier. A Bloomberg survey projected a decline to 75 in
yesterday’s report.  Bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft,
which reflect demand for productivity-enhancing equipment like
machinery and electrical gear, decreased 1.1 percent last month,
the second drop in three months, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion of two-year notes on Oct.
28, $35 billion of five-year securities on Oct. 29 and $29
billion of seven-year obligations the following day. It will be
the third consecutive month that the U.S. has reduced the
offering size of two-year debt.  The Treasury’s sale of $7 billion in inflation-indexed 30-year bonds on Oct. 24 attracted the most demand in a year as
investors sought a hedge against the risk the Fed will succeed
increasing inflation.  Consumer Prices  The sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.76,
versus an average of 2.67 at the 10 previous auctions since
2010. The bonds were sold at a yield of 1.33 percent.  Consumer  prices  rose 1.2 percent in September compared with
the 12-month-ago period, down from 1.5 percent in August, the
Labor Department is forecast to announce Oct. 30, according to
the median forecast of 42 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
