The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a 26 billion-euro ($36.8 billion) loan to Portugal as
part of a joint bailout with the European Union in the latest
effort to stem the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  The Washington-based institution will make 6.1 billion
euros available immediately, the fund said in an e-mailed
statement today. The IMF followed European officials, who on May
16 endorsed the 78-billion ($110 billion) joint package.  “The Portuguese authorities have put forward a program
that is economically well-balanced and has growth and job
creation at its center,” Acting Managing Director John Lipsky
said in the e-mailed statement today. “It addresses the
fundamental problem in Portugal - low growth - with a policy mix
based on restoring competitiveness through structural reforms,
ensuring a balanced fiscal consolidation path, and stabilizing
the financial sector.”  The backing for  Portugal  comes less than two days after the
resignation of  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  as managing director, who
was indicted yesterday in New York on charges including
attempted rape. French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde 
emerged as the leading contender to replace him, with officials
including  Angela Merkel  arguing that a European is needed for
the job because of the region’s debt woes.  The loan to Portugal has a duration of three years, the IMF
said.  “The financing package is designed to allow Portugal some
breathing space from borrowing in the markets while it
demonstrates implementation of the policy steps needed to get
the economy back on track,” the IMF said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
