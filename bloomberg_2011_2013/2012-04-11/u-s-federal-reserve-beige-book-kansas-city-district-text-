The following is the text of the
Federal Reserve Board’s Tenth District--  Kansas City .  TENTH DISTRICT - KANSAS CITY  The Tenth District economy expanded at a faster pace in late
February and March.  Consumer spending  improved, residential real
estate activity rose solidly, and commercial real estate
activity edged higher. Growth in the energy industry eased
slightly but remained solid. Manufacturing firms reported
further increases in activity, and agricultural conditions
improved from the previous survey. Transportation activity
picked up slightly, and high-tech service firms said sales
growth was mostly solid. Bankers noted steady loan demand,
better loan quality, and rising deposits. Prices rose slightly,
but wage pressures were contained outside of a few skilled
positions.  Consumer Spending  Consumer spending improved and expectations for the months ahead
remained solid. Retail sales rose moderately from the previous
survey, although several contacts noted concerns about lower
discretionary spending due to rising gasoline prices. Store
inventories remained stable and were expected to rise only
slightly in future months. Auto sales rebounded strongly from
the previous survey, with several dealers citing increased
customer traffic and pent up demand as key reasons. Contacts
said rising fuel prices have led to stronger sales of fuel
efficient vehicles, and sales of large SUVs and trucks weakened.
Expectations for future auto sales remained positive and
inventories continued to increase. Restaurant sales improved,
with further growth expected in coming months. Tourist activity
edged higher, with several contacts noting increased business
travel. Tourism contacts remained generally optimistic about
future months.  Manufacturing and Other Business Activity  District manufacturing activity grew solidly, and expectations
for future activity strengthened. Factory orders and shipments
increased, and employment growth remained steady with some
future hiring planned. Continued strong commodities-related
activity boosted machinery production, and high-tech and
aircraft manufacturing growth remained strong. Although rising
gasoline prices and continued economic uncertainty restrained
activity in several segments, most plant managers indicated
moderate growth in capital spending plans. Growth in
transportation activity picked up slightly, although several
contacts cited driver shortages and higher contractor fuel costs
as barriers to growth. Expectations for future sales were mostly
positive, but capital spending plans among transportation firms
were somewhat subdued. The majority of high-tech services firms
reported solid growth in sales, but the pace of growth slowed
somewhat from the previous survey. Several high-tech contacts
noted higher activity in the energy and health care market, and
future capital spending plans were generally positive.  Real Estate and Construction  Residential and commercial real estate activity increased in
late February and March, and expectations were solid heading
forward. Housing starts edged slightly higher, with several
contacts in  Nebraska  noting increased demand due to the booming
agricultural industry. Expectations for future homebuilding
remained positive, and building materials were generally
available. Sales at construction supply firms were stable, with
some contacts noting increased business among multi-family and
remodeling contractors, and expectations for future activity
were favorable. Home sales rose markedly from the previous
survey period and inventory levels fell, which contacts
attributed to seasonal patterns, favorable weather, lower
 interest rates , and newfound optimism in the overall economy.
Expectations for future home sales continued to strengthen, and
home price levels improved slightly. Mortgage lending activity
was positive and remained above year-ago levels, though contacts
expected refinancing volume to slow somewhat as rates begin to
rise. Commercial real estate activity continued to edge higher,
and expectations for future sales were mostly positive. Vacancy
rates dropped and were expected to fall further. Office prices
and rents remained subdued but were slightly higher than a year
ago, and expectations were largely flat. Several commercial real
estate contacts in  Oklahoma  noted strong sales due to heavy
activity in the  energy industry , while a contact in Missouri
expressed continued financing difficulties.  Banking  Bankers generally reported steady or stronger loan demand,
stable or improved loan quality, and increased deposits. Overall
loan demand was steady or improved. Most respondents reported
stable to increased loan demand for residential real estate
loans, while loan demand for commercial and industrial loans and
commercial real estate loans remained steady. Loan demand was
stable to weaker for consumer installment loans. Credit
standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan
categories, and the majority of respondents continued to report
increased deposits. Most bankers reported stable or improved
loan quality compared to a year ago, and every banker respondent
believed the outlook for loan quality over the next six months
would be steady or improving.  Energy  Energy activity grew solidly in late February and March, though
the pace of growth slowed slightly from previous surveys.
Contacts reported a sharp slowdown in natural gas drilling, with
many noting a shift towards oil exploration. Natural  gas prices 
reached decade-low levels in recent months, and most producers
expected prices to stay low due to oversupply and mild weather.
Crude  oil prices  climbed higher from the previous survey period,
which many contacts attributed to continued Middle East conflict
concerns. Contacts reported some shortages in equipment and
labor, particularly for engineers and experienced technical
support, and one producer noted continued delays in receiving
permits for drilling on federal land.  Agriculture  Agricultural growing conditions improved since the last survey.
Scattered rains increased soil moisture levels in many areas,
although drought conditions persisted in some western areas of
Kansas and Oklahoma. Winter wheat development was ahead of
normal with most of the crop upgraded to good condition. Mild
winter weather was favorable for calving and encouraged forage
growth, reducing the need for supplemental feeding. Spring field
work began early, and crop prices moved higher. Low cattle
inventories trimmed beef production, and strong domestic and
export demand pushed up cattle and hog prices. Operating loan
demand declined as many producers used cash to buy crop inputs.
Farmland values rose further and were expected to remain at
record highs.  Wages and Prices  Prices rose slightly and were expected to continue to increase,
but wage pressures were mostly contained outside of a few
skilled positions. Retailers reported a slight uptick in prices
with further increases anticipated. Manufacturing materials
price increases continued and were expected to increase further,
although fewer firms planned on raising selling prices. Higher
prices for construction materials narrowed profit margins, as
the majority of firms were unable to pass these costs through to
customers. Transportation firms reported higher input prices,
and increased food costs continued to impact profit margins and
selling prices for hotels and restaurants. Wage pressures were
still generally contained in most industries, although some
firms reported continued difficulties in obtaining skilled
labor.
