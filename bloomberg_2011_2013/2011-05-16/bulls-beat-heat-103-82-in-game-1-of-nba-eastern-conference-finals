The  Chicago  Bulls defeated Miami
103-82 in Game 1 of the National Basketball Association’s
Eastern Conference finals, outscoring the Heat by 22 points over
the final 19 minutes.  Derrick Rose scored 28 points for the Bulls, who trailed
58-57 last night before ending the game on a 46-24 scoring run
at the United Center in Chicago. Luol Deng added 21 points for
Chicago, which held Miami’s  LeBron James  and  Dwyane Wade  to a
combined 33 points and held a 45-33 rebounding advantage.  “We took it on the chin,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said
at a news conference. “Offensively, we got away from things we
normally do. They’re a great defensive team.”  The Bulls, the top seed in the East, improved to 4-0
against the Heat this season and host Game 2 in the best-of-
seven series in two days.  The Eastern Conference champion advances to the NBA Finals
against the  Dallas Mavericks  or Oklahoma City Thunder.  Oklahoma City reached the Western Conference finals
yesterday with a 105-90 victory over the  Memphis Grizzlies  in
Game 7 of their second-round playoff series.  Kevin Durant  scored
39 points to lead the Thunder, rebounding from his 11-point
effort in a Game 6 loss at Memphis.  “They earned this win,” Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins
said during a news conference. “Durant showed the heart of a
champion.”  Bulls Pull Away  In Chicago, the Bulls used a 10-0 third-quarter scoring run
to take the lead for good.  The Bulls hit 10 of 21 three-point attempts, including four
by Deng, who limited James to 15 points on 5-of-15 shooting.
Wade had 18 points for the Heat, while  Chris Bosh  led Miami with
30 points and nine rebounds.  Joakim Noah had 14 rebounds and  Carlos Boozer  added 14
points and nine rebounds for the Bulls, who had a league-leading
62 wins during the regular season. As the final minutes ticked
off the clock, the fans in Chicago chanted “over-rated” at the
second-seeded Heat, who are favored by oddsmakers to win the NBA
championship.  “We know we’re a good team,” Deng said in a televised
interview. “We’re just staying focused and in order to win,
you’ve got to think you’re the best. In the locker room, we
believe in each other.”  Durant Leads Thunder  The Thunder, who relocated from Seattle in 2008, are in the
Western Conference finals for the first time since 1996. Durant
tallied 18 points to lead all scorers as the Thunder took a
42-34 halftime lead at  Oklahoma City  Arena yesterday.  Durant also sparked Oklahoma City’s 14-2 scoring run late
in the third quarter, contributing nine points as the fourth-
seeded Thunder extended a three-point lead to 66-51. The NBA’s
leading scorer, Durant made 13 of 25 shots, while Russell Westbrook had 14 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds.  Mike Conley scored 18 points and Zach Randolph had 17
points and 10 rebounds for Memphis, which was seeking to become
the first No. 8 seed to reach the Western Conference finals. The
Grizzlies’ seven playoff wins set a record for an eighth-seeded
team in the West, bettering the six victories of the 1993-94
 Denver Nuggets .  The Western Conference finals start tomorrow in  Dallas . The
third-seeded Mavericks have been off since May 8, when they
completed a four-game sweep of the two-time defending champion
Los Angeles Lakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
