The number of civilians killed in
the conflict in  Afghanistan  increased 15 percent in 2010, to
2,777, even as fatalities linked to U.S. and allied military
forces decreased 26 percent, the United Nations said.  A report prepared by the UN, in cooperation with the
Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, said 440
civilians were killed in actions by pro-government forces. There
were 171 killed in allied air attacks, down 52 percent from 2009
levels.  “The overall rise in civilian deaths by anti-government
elements can be attributed to the increased use of improvised
explosive devices and targeted assassinations by anti-government
forces and intensified military operations, particularly in
southern Afghanistan,” the report said.  The report follows the U.S. military’s apology on March 1
for American helicopter strikes that killed nine boys cutting
firewood on a forested mountainside, after they were mistaken
for Taliban. Hundreds of Afghans marched in Kabul on March 6 to
protest civilian deaths.  The U.S. has about 97,000 troops in Afghanistan fighting
alongside almost 50,000 soldiers from 47 other nations. The
campaign has focused primarily on ousting the Taliban from the
most populous areas, including the southern provinces of
Kandahar and Helmand.  A total of 8,832 civilians suffered war-related deaths over
the past four years, a period in which the total grew each year,
according to the 85-page report, which was released today.  ‘Human Impact’  “The worsening human impact of the conflict reinforces the
need for parties to the conflict to do more to protect Afghan
civilians,” the report said. The UN and the Afghan Human Rights
Commission urged forces on both sides of the conflict to
“strengthen civilian protection and fully comply with their
legal obligations to minimize civilian casualties.”  Suicide attacks and IEDs caused the most deaths, 1,141, as
fatalities linked to anti-government forces amounted to 75
percent of the total, or 2,080. The report said the “most
alarming” trend in 2010 was the 462 civilians assassinated by
anti-government forces, a 105 percent increase over 2009. Half
occurred in Helmand and Kandahar.  The report said that while efforts by U.S., Afghan and
allied military forces to reduce civilian casualties were
“welcome,” concern remains about “full and consistent
implementation” of procedures to minimize the number and “lack
of transparency or investigations and accountability for
civilians causalities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
