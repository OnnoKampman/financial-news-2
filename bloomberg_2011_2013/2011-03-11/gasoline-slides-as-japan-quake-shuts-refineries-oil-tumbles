Gasoline slid, following crude oil
lower, after Japan’s strongest earthquake in at least a century
forced several oil refineries to close and lowered fuel demand.  Futures dropped the most in five weeks as Japanese
companies including JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. and Cosmo Oil
Co. have shut more than 820,000 barrels a day of capacity, or
about 19 percent of the country’s total processing ability.
Japan is the third-largest crude consumer.  “If there’s a lot of damage to refineries, for the time
being, supplies of oil that would normally be consumed by Japan
will be on the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for April delivery lost 4.46 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.975 a gallon at 9:33 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after touching $2.9425. Prices were heading
toward a weekly drop of 2.3 percent, the first loss in five
weeks.  The magnitude 8.9 earthquake struck off the coast of
Sendai, a city of 1 million in the northeast, unleashing a
tsunami as high as 10 meters (33 feet) that engulfed towns along
the coast.  Japan consumed 4.42 million barrels a day of crude in 2010,
according to data from the International Energy Agency’s Feb. 10
monthly Oil Market Report.  China  used 9.39 million and the U.S.
19.25 million, the agency said.  “This will lead to demand destruction and the initial
reaction of the market is going to be down,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in Chicago.    Brent crude  for April settlement declined $1.93 to $113.50
a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. Products
futures are vulnerable to changes in Brent because refineries
supplying fuel to New York Harbor, the delivery point for
heating oil and gasoline futures, process crude grades priced
relative to the European benchmark.  Nymex April crude sank $2.39 to $100.31 a barrel.  Heating oil for April delivery dropped 1.98 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.0251 a gallon and headed for a weekly drop of 2.1
percent.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, advanced
1.3 cents to $3.542 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website ,
the highest level since Oct. 4, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
