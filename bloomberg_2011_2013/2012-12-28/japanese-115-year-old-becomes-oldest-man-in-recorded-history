Jiroemon Kimura, a 115-year-old Japanese man born when Queen Victoria still reigned over the British Empire, became the oldest man in recorded history today, Guinness World Records said.  Kimura, of  Kyotango , western Japan, was born April 19, 1897, in the 30th year of the Meiji era, according to London-based Guinness. That makes him 115 years and 253 days as of today, breaking the longevity record for men held by Christian Mortensen of  California , who died in 1998 at the age of 115 years and 252 days. The oldest woman in recorded history, Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, died in 1997 at the age of 122.  “He has an amazingly strong will to live,” Kimura’s nephew Tamotsu Miyake, 80, said in an interview. “He is strongly confident that he lives right and well.”  Kimura is among 22 Japanese people on a list of the  world’s 64 oldest people  compiled by the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group, highlighting the challenges facing  Japan  as its population ages. A combination of the world’s highest life expectancy, the world’s  second-largest public debt  and a below- replacement birthrate is straining the nation’s pension system, prompting the government to curb payouts, raise contributions and delay the age of eligibility.  Japan’s average  life expectancy at birth  is 83 years, a figure projected to exceed 90 for women by 2050. The number of Japanese centenarians rose 7.6 percent from a year earlier to 51,376 as of September, and there are 40  centenarians  per 100,000 people in the country, which has the world’s highest proportion of elderly, according to Japan’s health ministry.  Oldest Living Person  Kimura became the world’s oldest currently living person on Dec. 17, when 115-year-old Dina Manfredini of  Iowa  died, according to Guinness and the Gerontology Research Group. Manfredini was born 15 days before Kimura.  Kimura was in a hospital this morning, Yasuhiro Kawato, head of the section for elderly welfare at Kyotango’s city hall, said by phone.  “His condition has improved, and we’re not worried, but the doctors said it would be best if he stayed in the hospital into the new year,” Kawato said.  The world’s second-oldest living person, Japanese woman Koto Okubo, turned 115 on Dec. 24.  Kimura is only the third man in history to reach 115 years of age, Guinness said in a statement today. He’s one of just four male supercentenarians, or people aged 110 or more, currently known to be alive, the organization said.  ‘Exceptional Person’  “To be able to present Mr. Kimura his second Guinness World Records title is truly an honor,” Guinness Editor-in- Chief Craig Glenday said in the statement. “Kimura-san is an exceptional person.”  Kimura lives with his grandson’s widow, Eiko Kimura, in a two-story wooden house he built in the 1960s. Eiko wakes him up every day at 7:30 a.m. and takes him by wheelchair to a dining room for breakfast consisting of porridge and miso soup with potatoes and vegetables. He has never suffered from serious diseases, can communicate and spends most of his time in bed, Eiko said.  “Grandpa is positive and optimistic,” she said. “He becomes cheerful when he has guests. He’s well with a good appetite. Even when he falls ill, I can tell he’ll recover.”  Sino-Japanese War  Kimura, the third of six children, was born as Kinjiro Miyake in Kamiukawa, a fishing and farming village sandwiched between the mountains and the Sea of Japan. His parents, Morizo and Fusa Miyake, were farmers who grew rice and vegetables.  Only two years earlier, Japan’s success in the First Sino- Japanese War had established the nation as the dominant power in  East Asia . Less than a year after Kimura was born, the sinking of the U.S. battleship  Maine  in Havana Harbor would trigger the Spanish-American War.  According to Kimura’s nephew Tamotsu, the 115-year-old’s birthday is actually March 19. Records say he was born April 19 because an official misprinted the month when records from merging towns were consolidated in 1955, the nephew said.  After finishing school at the age of 14 as the second-best student in his class, Kimura worked at local post offices for 45 years until his retirement in 1962 at the age of 65. He also worked at a government communication unit in  Korea  in the 1920s, when the peninsula was under Japanese rule, and returned to marry his neighbor Yae Kimura.  Disciplined, Serious  As his wife’s family didn’t have a male heir, he changed his name to Jiroemon Kimura, making him the ninth person in the family to bear the name. Since retiring, he has enjoyed reading newspapers and watching sumo wrestling on television. He sometimes helped his son farm until he was about 90 years old, Eiko Kimura said.  Kimura was a disciplined, serious man when he was younger, Miyake said. Even when he drank with his brothers, he would sit straight and keep quiet, Miyake said.  His wife, Yae, died 34 years ago at the age of 74. Four of Kimura’s five siblings lived to be more than 90 years old, and his youngest brother, Tetsuo, died at 100, Miyake said. Kimura’s living descendants include five children, 14 grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and 13 great-great-grandchildren.  The U.S. has an estimated 80,000 centenarians, or about 25 per 100,000 people, according to researchers at the  Okinawa Centenarian Study.   The mayor of Kyotango, a fishing center facing the  Sea of Japan  that’s known for snow crabs and oysters, congratulated Kimura on the town’s  Facebook  page. “Mr. Kimura, you are respected and adored as an example by our citizens aiming to make Kyotango a center of longevity and health,” wrote Mayor Yasushi Nakayama.
