1/  Includes any portion of the carcass affected by an inflammatory process,  plant-rejected carcasses, missing viscera, or ascites fluid preventing proper  inspection of the carcass.  Terms and Definitions Used for Poultry Slaughter Estimates  Ante-Mortem Condemnations: Birds condemned prior to their entry into the
slaughter plant.  Average Live Weight: The weight of the whole bird, before slaughter. Excludes
post-mortem condemnations.  Certified Ready-to-Cook: The weight of poultry certified wholesome by
inspection after post-mortem condemnation pounds are removed. Ready-to-cook
represents poultry meat ready for the marketing channel.  Dressing Percent: Usually expressed as a percentage yield of frozen and
chilled carcass in relation to the weight of the live bird.  Ducks: Includes all ducks regardless of age and weight.  Federally Inspected (FI) Plants: Plants that transport meat interstate must
employ federal inspectors to assure compliance with USDA standards.  Mature Chickens: Fowl from breeder and market egg flocks and stags and cocks.  Number of Head: Includes post-mortem condemnations.  Old Turkeys: Fully matured birds held for egg production, usually over 15
months of age.  Plant, Slaughter: An establishment where birds are killed and butchered.  Post-Mortem Condemnations: Carcasses or parts condemned by the inspector
because of disease or mishandling and removed from the slaughter line and
destroyed.  Slaughter: Killing and butchering of birds primarily for food.  Total Live Weight: The total weight of live birds, before slaughter. Excludes
post-mortem condemnations.  Young Chickens: Commercially grown broilers-fryers and other young immature
birds such as roasters and capons.  Young Turkeys: Young birds grown to a matured market age, about 5 months and
other turkeys such as fryers/roasters and young breeders.  Statistical Methodology  Data Sources: Data for poultry slaughter estimates are collected by
inspectors of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), USDA for all
Federally Inspected (FI) plants. Over 99 percent of the total U.S. slaughter
for any species is under FI. The number of head slaughtered daily, by species
and class, as well as condemnations and total live and dressed weights are
obtained by shift for each plant. Approximately 310 plants slaughtered
poultry in the United States under Federal Inspection in 2010. Young chickens
were slaughtered in 38 States, young turkeys in 26 States.  Revision Policy: Data for the previous month and year-to-date totals are
subject to revision the following month after the initial monthly estimates
are published. Final data are published in the annual summary released in
February and include any revisions made to current year’s and previous year’s
published data. Revisions are generally the result of late reports or
corrections received by FSIS from plants and are usually less than one-half
of one percent. No revisions will be made to the previous year’s data after
publication of the annual summary in February.  Procedures and Reliability: Plant inspectors submit data electronically for
each shift a plant operates. An edit provides checks for the detection of
errors such as invalid plant information, duplication, and erroneous data.
Data are accumulated to monthly totals for this release.  Data for major slaughter plants with missing reports are adjusted prior to
publication to assure that all plants slaughtering a significant portion of a
specific class are included. Estimates for missing shifts are made only after
verifying that the plant was in operation. Adjustments are based on a shift
determined to be similar to the one missing. Late reports replace imputed
data as they become available. While there is a varying degree of
incompleteness from month to month, it has only a minimal impact on the
published totals.  Poultry slaughter estimates are based on a census of operating plants and,
therefore, have no sampling error. However, they may be subject to errors
such as omissions, duplications, and mistakes in reporting, recording, and
processing the data. These errors are minimized through strict quality
controls in the edit and summarization process, and a careful review of all
reported data for consistency and reasonableness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
