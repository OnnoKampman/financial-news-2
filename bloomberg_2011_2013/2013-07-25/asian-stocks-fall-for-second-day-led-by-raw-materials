Asia’s benchmark  stock  index fell
for a second day as investors weighed corporate earnings and
awaited U.S. economic data that may shed light on when the
Federal Reserve will taper stimulus.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s No. 1 camera maker, tumbled 5.4
percent in Tokyo after cutting its sales and profit forecast.
Komatsu Ltd., Japan’s largest construction machinery maker,
dropped 2.4 percent after U.S. bellwether Caterpillar Inc.
lowered its earnings estimate. Chinese rail shares rose in Hong
Kong as Premier Li Keqiang said the nation will speed railway
construction.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8 percent to 135.84 as
of 6:45 p.m. in Tokyo, with all 10 industry groups on the
measure falling. More than two stocks slid for each that rose.  “U.S. data right now is good, but whether it’s good enough
for the Fed to stop buying assets, the market will still need to
see,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai
Securities in Hong Kong. “Investors are chasing some stocks
that benefit from  China ’s policies, but since some of their
share prices shot up, there may be some profit taking.”  The  MSCI measure  gained 5.9 percent this year through
yesterday with consumer discretionary shares rising the most and
energy shares falling the most. The index traded at 13.4 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with 15.3 times for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.5 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Regional Gauges  Japan’s Topix index  slipped 1.4 percent and the Nikkei 225
Stock Average lost 1.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index lost
0.1 percent even as data showed the nation’s economy grew the
most in more than two years.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped 0.5 percent
after the central bank kept its key interest rate at 2.5 percent
today.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.3 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite slid 0.6 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index fell
0.4 percent, while  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index declined 1.2
percent, the most in three weeks.  Futures of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent
today. The measure slid 0.4 percent in New York yesterday as
investors weighed earnings reports from Caterpillar and Apple
Inc. A report showed sales of new U.S. homes rose more than
forecast in June to the highest level in five years.  U.S. Jobs  The number of people in the U.S. continuing to claim
jobless benefits fell by 89,000 in the week to July 13,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before data due
today.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has said asset purchases that
have stoked bond and equity gains may be trimmed this year
should economic risks subside.  Canon fell 5.4 percent to 3,245 yen in  Tokyo , the second-biggest loss on the Nikkei 225, after saying yesterday that net
income will probably be 260 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in 2013,
cutting its April projection of 290 billion yen by 10 percent.
Canon faces slowing demand for compact and high-end cameras with
interchangeable lenses.  Komatsu dropped 2.4 percent to 2,330 yen after Caterpillar
said earnings in 2013 will be about $6.50 a share on sales of
$56 billion to $58 billion. That’s lower than analysts’
estimates and down from the company’s April projection of about
$7 a share on revenue of $57 billion to $61 billion. Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co. fell 2.3 percent to 2,137 yen.  “We are a little bit disappointed in Asian growth, not
only in earnings, but also in revenue particularly, and so
people are reassessing that at this stage.,” said  Tim Schroeders , a portfolio manager who helps manage $1 billion in
equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne .  Earnings Analysis  Of the 73 companies in the Asia-Pacific gauge that have
posted quarterly results and for which Bloomberg has estimates,
59 percent beat projections while 41 percent missed them, the
data show.  Chinese rail shares gained after Premier Li said China will
speed railway construction, especially in central and western
regions. The State Council yesterday also approved tax breaks
for small companies and reduced fees for exporters, according to
a statement after a meeting led by Li.  China Railway Group Ltd., the country’s No. 2 train-line
builder, added 1.8 percent to HK$4.26. CSR Corp., the country’s
biggest maker of rolling stock, gained 2.4 percent to HK$5.45.  Kao Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest maker of toiletries, had the
largest two-day slump in more than two years after more than
2,000 consumers reported skin blotches from using some of its
whitening products. Kao dropped 3.4 percent to 3,120 yen after
sliding 6.2 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
