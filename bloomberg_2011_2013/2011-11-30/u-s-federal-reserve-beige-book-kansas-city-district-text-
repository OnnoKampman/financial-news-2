The following is the text of the
Federal Reserve Board’s Tenth District--  Kansas City .  TENTH DISTRICT - KANSAS CITY  Growth in the Tenth District economy edged higher in October and
early November but remained moderate overall.  Consumer spending 
improved further, and manufacturing activity rose modestly.
High-tech firms reported generally strong growth, and the  energy
industry  continued to expand at a robust pace. Bankers reported
mostly steady loan demand, better loan quality, and rising
deposits. Transportation firms reported stable activity, while
agricultural activity was mixed due to varying rainfall and
drought conditions across the District. Residential and
commercial real estate activity remained sluggish, though some
improvements were noted. Prices were generally flat, and wage
pressures were limited outside of several skilled labor
positions.  Consumer Spending. Consumer spending strengthened, and
expectations improved for the months ahead. Retail sales
continued to grow solidly, and the majority of contacts expected
continued sales growth in coming months. Sales of apparel and
seasonal outerwear were noted as particularly strong, while a
few contacts characterized sales of high-end appliances and
jewelry items as weak. Store inventories leveled out somewhat
but were above year-ago levels in most establishments. Auto
sales remained solid, with several dealers reporting high demand
for mid-size SUVs and fuel efficient vehicles. Expectations for
future auto sales were mostly positive, and auto inventories
increased slightly over the previous survey. Restaurant sales
improved, with further growth expected in coming months. Tourist
activity was largely flat, but some contacts were cautiously
optimistic about the upcoming winter season.  Manufacturing and Other Business Activity. District
manufacturing activity edged higher from the previous survey,
and expectations rebounded after easing somewhat the past few
months. Factory orders slowed slightly, but shipments increased
and hiring plans remained solid. Plant managers indicated
moderate growth in capital spending plans. Transportation firms
noted generally stable conditions, but expectations for future
activity increased over the previous survey and capital spending
plans were positive. The majority of high-tech services firms
reported strong growth in sales and expected this trend to
continue. Future capital expenditure plans at high-tech firms
remained solid.  Real Estate and Construction. Residential and commercial real
estate activity remained generally sluggish in October and early
November. Housing starts dropped from the previous survey, with
construction of higher-priced homes particularly weak.
Expectations for future homebuilding remained slow, and
materials were generally available. Sales at residential
construction supply firms improved somewhat, driven in part by
an increase in remodeling as more consumers updated existing
homes. Home sales picked up slightly but remained weak overall.
Expectations for future home sales were more positive than in
previous months, and home inventories drifted lower as  home
prices  continued to ease in most areas. Mortgage lending
activity was positive and remained above year-ago levels, though
some contacts reported continued buyer financing difficulties.
Commercial real estate activity edged higher from the previous
survey, but remained sluggish overall with little further
improvement expected. Vacancy rates dropped slightly, though
they were expected to rise somewhat in future months. Office
prices and rents increased but remained below year-ago levels,
and expectations were flat. One contact in Joplin,  Missouri 
noted considerable building activity as a result of the
devastating tornado in that area last spring.  Banking. Most bankers reported steady or stronger loan demand,
stable or improving loan quality, and increased deposits
compared with the previous survey. Overall loan demand increased
marginally as demand for commercial and residential real estate
loans strengthened, demand for consumer installment loans
declined, and demand for commercial and industrial loans
weakened slightly. Credit standards remained largely unchanged
in all major loan categories, and deposits increased for the
seventh straight survey. Bankers generally reported loan quality
as steady or improving compared to a year ago, with even more
improvement expected for the next six months.  Energy. Energy activity continued to expand strongly in October
and early November. Nearly all contacts reported an increase in
drilling activity and were optimistic about the months ahead.
Crude  oil prices  remained favorable for drilling, and one
contact noted that overall drilling activity was approaching
levels reached before the price collapse in 2008. However,
contacts reported that shortages of equipment and labor
continued to constrain the rate of increase in exploration to
some degree, and one producer said the delay in the Keystone
Pipeline project was hindering future growth.  Agriculture. Agricultural activity varied across the District in
October and early November. Northern portions of the District,
which received ample summer precipitation, reported above
average corn and soybean yields at harvest and the majority of
 Nebraska ’s wheat crop emerged in good condition. In contrast,
drought conditions severely cut crop production in the
District’s southern regions, with Kansas and Oklahoma winter
wheat crops in fair or poor condition. Robust export demand
continued to boost crop and livestock prices. Farm income rose
in areas with bumper harvests, while crop insurance was expected
to mitigate losses in cases of poor yields or crop failure.
Strong farm income boosted farm loan repayment rates and trimmed
demand for operating loans. With rising farm income and strong
demand from both farmers and non-farm investors, District
farmland values posted another record high, with the strongest
gains in the northern Plains.  Wages and Prices. Price levels were generally stable, and wage
pressures remained mostly contained, outside of a few skilled
positions. Manufacturing price pressures moderated somewhat,
especially for raw materials, and fewer firms planned to raise
selling prices. Prices for construction materials stabilized,
and retail prices were also flat as fewer firms expected
increases. However, transportation firms reported continued high
input prices, and restaurants expected higher menu prices due to
rising food costs. Wage pressures were still contained in most
industries. However, some firms reported difficulties finding
skilled workers and were forced to raise wages, particularly in
energy and  information technology  fields. Hiring plans were
generally solid for most firms, particularly those in the energy,
information technology, and manufacturing sectors.
