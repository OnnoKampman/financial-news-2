Olivier Metzner , one of France’s
best-known lawyers, was found dead from an apparent suicide, the
prosecutor’s office in the Brittany city of Vannes said.  Metzner’s body was found yesterday floating off an island
he owned in Brittany’s Bay of Morbihan, and he left behind a
note, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office said by
telephone. The results of an autopsy will be announced today,
she said.  Metzner, 63, represented former  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  trader
 Jerome Kerviel , heiress Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, politician
Dominique de Villepin, businessmen Loik Le Floch-Prigent and
 Jean-Marie Messier , as well as Continental Airlines in the 2000
Concorde crash.  “He was one of the greatest case lawyers of our bar who
knew best how to make legal procedure a weapon in the service of
justice,” Christiane Feral-Schuhl, head of the Paris bar, said
in an interview with  Agence France-Presse .  The cigar-chomping, media-friendly Metzner started his
career defending gang members, making a name for himself by
freeing clients on technicalities. He developed an expertise in
financial law in the 1980s as he defended businessmen and
politicians caught in political party financing cases.  “Olivier Metzner was totally devoted to his clients to
whom he consecrated his extreme intelligence,” Georges Kiejman,
a Paris lawyer he often faced in court, told BFM TV. “His death
leaves a big loss in the Paris bar.”  There was no answer yesterday outside of normal business
hours at the Paris offices of his firm, Metzner & Associes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
