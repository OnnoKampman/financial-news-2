Following is the text of the weekly
 U.S. Drought Monitor  as released by the National Drought
Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska:  Weekly Weather Summary: Despite scattered, locally heavy showers
across the Midwest and Southeast, hot weather continued to have
a detrimental impact on summer crops.  The heat’s effects were
amplified in areas largely bypassed by showers, including a
broad arc of farmland stretching from southern  Iowa  into western
 Ohio .  Meanwhile, an already dire situation continued to worsen
across the south-central U.S., where the combination of an
historic 10-month drought and a relentless summer heat wave left
little hope for rain-fed commodities and placed significant
stress on livestock and irrigated crops.  Farther west, an
active monsoon circulation contributed to beneficial showers in
the Four Corners States.  Elsewhere, Southeastern showers helped
to offset the effects of hot weather, especially in the central
Gulf Coast region and parts of the southern Atlantic States,
while Tropical Storm Don which made landfall in Deep South Texas
on July 29 was a tremendous disappointment with minimal rainfall.  The Midwest and Northeast: Patchy agricultural dryness (D0A)
continued to develop from the Midwest into the Northeast, with
some pockets of drought (D1A) beginning to appear.  In many
areas, persistent heat aggravated the effects of short-term
dryness.  For example,  Detroit ,  Michigan , set a record for its
hottest month (79.3F; previously, 79.0F in July 1921 and 1955).
Meanwhile in Indiana, Ft. Wayne not only set a record for its
hottest month, but also experienced a record-high number of 90-
degree days in July (22; previously, 21 days in 1983).  In  Pennsylvania , nearly one-third (31%) of the corn crop was
rated in very poor to poor conditions at the end of July.  Not
far behind were  Missouri  (28% of the corn very poor to poor) and
Indiana (21%). Pastures continued to burn up, with more than
half reported in very poor to poor condition on July 31 in
Pennsylvania (58%) and  Maryland  (55%).  Topsoil moisture was
rated 85% very short to short in Maryland; end-of-July values in
other states included 78% in Pennsylvania, 69% in Missouri, 66%
in  Delaware , 64% in  New York , and 63% in Indiana.  Ironically, some areas received heavy rain.  For example, daily-
record totals in Michigan for July 27 reached 3.49 inches in
Grand Rapids and 2.15 inches in Lansing.  On July 28, Wisconsin
locations such as Wisconsin Rapids (3.20 inches) and Green Bay
(2.25 inches) tallied daily-record amounts.  Dubuque, Iowa, was
hammered by 10.62 inches of rain in a 24-hour period on July 27-
28, establishing an all-time record. Previously, Dubuque’s
highest 24-hour rainfall had been 8.96 inches on August 21-22,
2002.  Dubuque also experienced its wettest calendar day on
record (7.47 inches on July 27), shattering its former mark of
6.28 inches set on July 1, 1961.  In fact, Midwestern monthly
rainfall totals were extraordinarily variable, with Dubuque
(16.01 inches) experiencing its wettest month on record and
Indianapolis,  Indiana  (0.47 inch), weathering its driest July.  The Southeast: Locally heavy showers kept drought
intensification at bay in some areas and resulted in some
additional drought relief in the central Gulf Coast region.  In
fact, New Orleans, Louisiana, received daily-record rainfall
amounts on July 25 and 28 (2.34 and 3.52 inches, respectively),
and ended the month with 13.00 inches of precipitation (210
percent of normal).  However, even rain-affected locations had
to deal with record-setting heat.  In  North Carolina , Wilmington
(101F on July 30) tied an annual record with its seventh day of
triple-digit heat.  Wilmington originally set its annual record
of seven 100-degree readings in 1952.  By July 31, more than half (56%) of  South Carolina ’s pastures
were rated in very poor to poor condition.  South Carolina also
led the Southeast with topsoil moisture rated 77% very short to
short.  Nearly one-third (32%) of the cotton was rated very poor
to poor by the end of July in Alabama and Georgia.  Peanuts (30%
very poor to poor) were struggling in Alabama.  Nearly one-half
(45%) of North Carolina’s corn was rated very poor to poor.  The Central and Southern Plains and The Mid-South:  Tropical
Storm Don which made landfall on July 29 between Brownsville and
Corpus Christi was a mighty disappointment for parched  Texas .
Scattered showers, totaling mostly less than an inch, were
limited to Deep South Texas, as the storm literally
disintegrated upon moving inland. Meanwhile, a record-shattering
string of 100-degree readings continued into August across parts
of the Lone Star State.  Tyler, TX, posted a 36-day streak (and
counting) of triple-digit heat from June 28 to August 2, nearly
doubling its former mark of 20 days set from July 15 to August 3,
1998.  Dallas-Ft. Worth registered highs of 100F or higher on 32
consecutive days (and counting) from July 2 to August 2, second
only to a 42-day stretch of triple-digit heat from June 23 to
August 3, 1980.  With an average temperature of 89.2F, July 2011
was the hottest month on record in  Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma,
smashing its Dust Bowl-era record of 88.7F set in August 1936.
Childress, Texas (90.2F), also demolished its long-standing
hottest month record, previously set with 89.0F in July 1934.
Elsewhere in Texas, Wichita Falls (92.9F) edged its July 1980
standard of 91.9F.  For the second consecutive month, Lubbock,
TX, experienced its hottest month on record (85.9?F in June and
86.0F in July; previously, 85.4F in July 1966).  Adding insult
to injury was the ongoing historic drought.  For example,
Midland, Texas, completed another month without measurable
precipitation (rainfall greater than a trace last fell on May
20).  Midland also endured its driest 10-month period on record,
with just 0.18 inch falling from October 2010 - July 2011.  The
previous record-low precipitation for any 10-month period in
Midland was 2.60 inches from October 1950 - July 1951.  The coverage of Texas rangeland and pastures in very poor to
poor conditions stood at 93% on July 31, according to USDA.  The
rangeland and pasture situation was nearly as bad in Oklahoma
(86% very poor to poor),  Arkansas  (79%), and  Kansas  (57%).
Oklahoma’s row crops were in particularly bad shape, with USDA
rating 88% of the cotton and 74% of the sorghum in very poor to
poor condition.  By month’s end, topsoil moisture was reported
to be 100% very short to short in Oklahoma, 97% in Texas, 89% in
Arkansas, and 73% in Kansas.  The Southwest: An active monsoon circulation continued to
generate scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Four
Corners States. July ended wetter than normal at many
Southwestern locations, including Douglas,  Arizona  (3.57 inches,
or 114% of normal), and Grand Junction, Colorado (1.71 inches,
or 259%).  However, recovery in drought-affected areas was slow,
with rangeland and pastures struggling to rebound.  At the end
of July, USDA rated 88% of New Mexico’s rangeland and pastures
in very poor to poor condition, along with 64% in Arizona.  Puerto Rico,  Hawaii , and  Alaska : Tropical Storm Emily formed
southeast of Puerto Rico on August 1 but contributed to an
overall wet pattern in early August across the Greater Antilles.
Meanwhile, lackluster summer showers across Hawaii’s Big Island
led to expanded coverage of dryness (D0) and drought (D1 and D2).
In particular, moderate drought (D1) coverage increased due to
increased irrigation demands and deteriorating pasture
conditions.  Farther north, heavy precipitation fell across much
of southeastern Alaska in late July, leading to a reduction in
the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0).  July 24-30 rainfall
totaled 2.33 inches in Juneau, boosting its monthly sum to 3.51
inches (85 percent of normal).  Nearly two-thirds (2.54 of 3.86
inches) of Yakutat’s monthly rain fell from July 24-30.  Looking Ahead: During the next 5 days (from August 4-8),
excessively hot conditions will persist across the south-central
and southeastern U.S., while cooler air will overspread the
Midwest.  Little or no rain will fall in the Far West and the
drought-devastated south-central U.S.  However, most other areas
including the northern and central Plains, Midwest, and East can
expect 1 to 2 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts.  Most
forecast guidance suggests that Tropical Storm Emily will turn
away before reaching the U.S. mainland, although a weekend
landfall along the southern Atlantic Coast cannot be ruled out.  The CPC 6- to 10-day outlook for August 9-13 calls for below-
normal temperatures along and near the Pacific Coast and from
the Midwest into the Northeast, while hotter-than-normal weather
will prevail from the Four Corners region into the Southeast.
Meanwhile, below-normal rainfall in  California  and across the
nation’s southern tier will contrast with wetter-than-normal
conditions from the northern Plains to New England, including
the Midwest.  SOURCE: National Drought Mitigation Center  To contact the reporter on this story:
