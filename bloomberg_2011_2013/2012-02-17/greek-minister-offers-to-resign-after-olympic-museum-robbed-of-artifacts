Greek Culture Minister Pavlos Yeroulanos offered to resign after the museum of ancient
Olympia, birthplace of the  Olympic Games , was robbed, the second
major art heist this year.  Yeroulanos went to the museum in southern  Greece  this
morning to assess the situation after submitting his resignation
to Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , a ministry spokesman said in
a phone interview given on condition of anonymity. There was no
response from the prime minister’s office on whether the
resignation was accepted.  The robbery occurred at 7:34 a.m., according to a statement
posted on the website of the Athens-based Hellenic Police. Two
hooded, armed men disarmed the museum guard and stole bronze and
ceramic artefacts as well as a gold ring, according to the
statement. Olympia’s Mayor Efthimios Kotzias told state-run NET
TV about 65 items were taken.  The robbery is the second major theft in two months. On
Jan. 9, police reported three works of art, including a painting
by  Pablo Picasso  and donated by the artist to the Greek people,
were stolen from the National Gallery of Art in central  Athens .
The thieves are still at large.  The Olympic museum is considered one of the  most important 
in Greece, housing priceless artefacts from the sanctuary of
Olympia, which hosts the torch-lighting ceremony for the modern
Olympic Games. The site was recently restored after being
damaged by forest fires in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
