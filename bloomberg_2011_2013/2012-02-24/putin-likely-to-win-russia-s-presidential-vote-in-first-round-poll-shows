Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  will
probably win Russia’s presidential election in the first round
on March 4, three surveys published today showed.  Putin has the support of 66 percent of decided voters, said
Lev Gudkov, director of the independent  Levada Center . The prime
minister has 53.5 percent backing, the All-Russian Center for
the Study of  Public Opinion , a state-run pollster known as
VTsIOM, said today. Putin is set to capture 58.7 percent of the
vote, according to the projection of the Public Opinion
Foundation, or FOM, published today.  “A second round is very unlikely,” Gudkov said today at a
news conference in Moscow. “Populist promises contained the
downward trend and led to elevated expectations.”  Putin, 59, is seeking a return to the Kremlin amid the
biggest challenge to his 12-year rule after fraud allegations at
parliamentary polls sparked mass protests. The prime minister,
who served as president from 2000 to 2008, needs to garner at
least 50 percent to avoid a second-round runoff.  Since hitting a two-month high on Dec. 20 amid the
protests, the yield on  Russia ’s benchmark dollar notes due 2015
has tumbled 107 basis points to 2.4703 percent today, a record
low. The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries fell 86 basis points in the same
period to 295 today, the lowest spread on a closing basis since
Oct. 28, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  EMBIG indexes.  Ruble Rises  The ruble advanced 10 percent since Dec. 29 to 29.2805 by
3:48 p.m in Moscow today, its strongest level since Sept. 2.
Russia’s Micex Index jumped 17 percent since hitting a two-month
low on Dec. 12, beating the 15 percent gain for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index in the same period.  In the Levada poll, the institute’s last before the vote,
Communist Party leader  Gennady Zyuganov  was second with 15
percent, followed by  Vladimir Zhirinovsky  of the  Liberal
Democratic Party  with 8 percent, then billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  and former Putin ally Sergei Mironov at 6 percent and
5 percent, respectively.  Zyuganov is at 16.2 percent, Zhirinovsky may get 8.8
percent, Prokhorov 8.6 percent and Mironov 6.1 percent, FOM said
in e-mail. Zyuganov was at 10.8 percent in the VTsIOM survey
that included an option for those not planning to vote.  Levada’s survey was conducted from Feb. 17 to Feb. 20 and
the VTsIOM poll was done Feb. 18 and Feb. 19. Both included
1,600 respondents and had a margin of error of 3.4 percentage
points. FOM surveyed 3,000 people in 64 Russian regions on Feb.
18 and 19. It didn’t give a margin of error.  Campaign Pledges  Putin’s campaign pledges will raise  government spending  by
4.8 trillion rubles ($164 billion), or as much as 5 percent of
economic output, through 2018, according to a Capital Economics
estimate. The Russian leader’s power base is concentrated in
medium and small cities and villages, where Putin is “a symbol
of stability and hope for rising prosperity,” said Gudkov.  Potential disappointment over promises not kept may boil
over into social tension later this year, according to Gudkov.
Russians are continuing to lose faith in Putin, and a long-term
rise in his popularity is “no longer possible,” he said.  “We’ll be living with a weak authoritarian leader,”
Gudkov said. “And that’s a situation that won’t satisfy
anyone.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
