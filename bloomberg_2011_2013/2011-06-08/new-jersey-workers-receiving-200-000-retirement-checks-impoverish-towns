Raymond Carnevale, former finance
chief in Hackensack, New Jersey, didn’t wait for Governor  Chris Christie  to end payouts for unused sick time and vacation. He
cashed in 402 accrued days for $267,573 and retired last May
with an annual pension of $39,868.  “To say it’s getting out while the getting’s good is too
harsh: It’s more like getting out while it’s safe,” Carnevale,
64, who spent 24 years on Hackensack’s payroll and 41 total in
municipal government, said in an interview.  Hackensack, a city of about 43,000 people seven miles (11
kilometers) west of  New York City , paid $4.6 million of sick and
vacation time to 36 retiring workers including Carnevale this
budget year. Eight older workers not subject to a city cap on
the payments received checks exceeding $200,000. The rush to
retire is attributable to Christie’s proposed clampdown on
workers’ benefits, City Manager Stephen Lo Iacono said.  New Jersey  municipalities including Hackensack and the two
most populous, Newark and  Jersey City , had to borrow to make the
sick-leave payments after cutting jobs to balance their budgets.
The higher costs are swamping local governments from New Jersey
to California as states grapple with pension-funding deficits of
as much as $479.5 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In the past year, New Jersey communities from Newark to
Camden paid workers at least $43 million for unused sick and
vacation time. Statewide, 428 municipalities face liabilities of
more than $825 million for accumulated sick and vacation days,
which would cost an additional $250 for every property taxpayer
in the state, according to Christie’s office.  ‘Only in Government’  Christie, a first-term Republican, wants to end the
payouts, while Democrats, who control the Legislature, seek to
cap them. The governor’s proposal would bar workers from
accumulating additional sick and vacation days, and force
current employees to use banked days for sick time or vacation.
In December, he  vetoed  Democratic legislation capping the
payments for all workers at $15,000.  “There’s no way to justify paying cash to people for not
being sick,” Christie, 48, said at a May 18 town-hall meeting
in Monroe Township. “Only in government would we do something
like this.”  Christie calls the payments "boat checks" to explain where
some of the money may be going. The $43 million in payouts
included $306,000 paid to the West New York mayor’s chief of
staff and $80,000 to the Somerville school superintendent,
according to a  list  from Christie’s office. Camden, one of the
nation’s poorest cities, paid out $3.5 million after eliminating
25 percent of its workforce.  Municipal Aid  Christie cut aid to municipalities and schools by $1.3
billion to help balance the current state budget. In September,
he proposed rolling back a 9 percent benefits increase enacted
in 2001, freezing cost-of-living raises and increasing the
minimum retirement age to help reduce a $53.9 billion deficit in
the state pension system.  The governor also wants workers to pay 30 percent of the
cost of health-insurance premiums, up from the current 8.5
percent.  Christie and unions for government workers have clashed
since he took office in January 2010. The New Jersey Education
Association spent $6.6 million last year, more than any other
lobbying organization, on ads criticizing Christie’s proposals.  Leaving Workforce  Public-employee retirements jumped by 60 percent in 2010 to
more than 20,000 as Christie pushed his proposals. Through the
beginning of June, 17,997 workers have submitted retirement
papers this year, according to state records. If applications
continue at the current pace, at least 23,000 police, teachers
and other public workers will retire this year, a 14 percent
jump from last year.  New Jersey isn’t alone in allowing towns to pay employees
lump sums for unused sick and vacation days. In  California , Anne
Montgomery was paid $315,531 in 2009 as city manager of  Mill
Valley , a San Francisco suburb of 14,000 people. That included
$124,000 for unused leave, according to data provided by the
League of California Cities and the controller’s office.  When Ken Hampian retired as city manager of San Luis
Obispo, California, in 2009, he augmented his $194,168 base
salary with $52,144 by cashing out unused vacation and
administrative leave, according to figures listed in a 2010
survey of city manager pay conducted by the League.  Unused Time  California Governor  Jerry Brown , a Democrat, has said he
will support legislation that would forbid municipal employees
from including unused vacation and sick time in their pension
calculations. That practice isn’t allowed in New Jersey.  Carnevale, the Hackensack official, said the payouts were
among the biggest expenses he had to cover each year when
preparing budgets. While previous labor agreements in the city
allowed workers to retain the payments, he said he supports
either capping or getting rid of them for new hires.  Hackensack Mayor Karen Sasso, a Democrat elected to the
nonpartisan office, called the increase in sick-leave payouts
the “other shoe” to Christie’s efforts to cut pension costs.  “They were afraid of what they might lose,” Sasso, 60,
said of the retirements. “We couldn’t budget for that kind of
mass exodus.”  Assemblywoman Pamela Lampitt, a Camden Democrat, has
offered Christie a compromise that would cap sick-leave payouts
at $7,500. Based on 434,017 current state and local employees,
that bill would cost taxpayers $3.25 billion, said Christie, who
rejected the offer.  Firefighters Retire  Newark , the state’s largest city, borrowed $7 million in
December to cover the cost of retiree payments, Business
Administrator Julien Neals said. The fire department, which had
100 of 700 members retire last year, accounted for more than $6
million of that total, fire director Fateen Ziyad said.  “The governor has made us out to be the new Wall Street
fat cats,” Ziyad said in an interview. “The fact is that all
of these things were negotiated.”  Jersey City has incurred $19.6 million in payouts since
July 2009 as 180 police officers and firefighters retired ahead
of planned pension changes and payout limits. Six recipients got
more than $200,000 last fiscal year, including $252,000 paid to
Deputy Fire Chief Robert Flora. In December, the city issued
$9.3 million in one-year notes to cover part of the total and
avert a 4 percent tax increase.  “They are a huge burden and may ultimately be proven
unsustainable,” Mayor Jerramiah Healy said of the payments in
an e-mail. “As it goes forward into the future, the burden is
only going to be that much more difficult.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
