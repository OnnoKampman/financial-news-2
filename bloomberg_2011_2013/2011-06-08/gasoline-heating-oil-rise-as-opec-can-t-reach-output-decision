Gasoline and heating oil rose after
OPEC ministers couldn’t reach a decision on production quotas at
their meeting in Vienna today, according to the group’s
secretary-general, Abdalla el-Badri.  Futures followed crude oil higher after Badri said
ministers didn’t reach a consensus. The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries was poised to boost output for the
first time since 2007.  “The OPEC meeting just broke up with no consensus on
production levels and the market was anticipating they would
increase production,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 1.77 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $3.0096 a gallon at 10:04 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices fell as low as $2.9623 earlier before jumping
to $3.0265 after the OPEC announcement.  OPEC accounts for 40 percent of the world’s oil supply. The
production limit has been unchanged since December 2008, when it
was capped at 24.845 million barrels a day for all members
except Iraq.  “It looked as if some people were betting on a million-
and-a-half barrel hike coming through,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .
“Meanwhile, the economy is still kind of sputtering. And
there’s plenty of supplies.”  Crude Rises  Brent crude  gained $1.14, or 1 percent, to $117.92 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Product futures
are vulnerable to changes in Brent because refineries on the
U.S. East Coast process oil grades that are sold relative to the
European benchmark.  Crude oil for July delivery rose $1.35, or 1.4 percent, to
$100.44 a barrel on the Nymex.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  Stockpiles of gasoline probably rose 1.05 million barrels,
according to the median estimate of 14 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg News.  Inventories of diesel and heating oil likely increased
125,000 barrels, according to the survey. Oil stockpiles
probably fell 1.38 million barrels.  Gasoline demand at the pump slid 2.9 percent last week,
according to a  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  SpendingPulse report yesterday.  “The market is keeping an eye on demand destruction,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
Chicago.  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 1.3 cents to $3.748 a
gallon, AAA said on its website. That’s the lowest price since
April 7.  Heating oil for July delivery added 2.18 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.0988 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
