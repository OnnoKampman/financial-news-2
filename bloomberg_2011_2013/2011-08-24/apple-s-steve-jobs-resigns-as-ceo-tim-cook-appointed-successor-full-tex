The following is a reformatted
version of the full text of today’s resignation letter from
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  founder Steve Jobs:  To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:  I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no
longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would
be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.  I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if
the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple
employee.  As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we
execute our  succession plan  and name  Tim Cook  as CEO of Apple.  I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are
ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to
its success in a new role.  I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple,
and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work
alongside you.  Steve  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
