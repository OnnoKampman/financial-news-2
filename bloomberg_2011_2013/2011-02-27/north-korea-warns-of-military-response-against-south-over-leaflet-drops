  North Korea  threatened to take
military action if the South continues to drop leaflets and
other propaganda encouraging revolt, threatening a return of
tension on the peninsula that roiled markets last year.  North Korea will fire at South Korean locations, including
the Imjin Pavilion tourist lookout near the border, used to
launch balloons carrying leaflets and animation clips saved on
memory sticks and DVDs, along with U.S. one dollar bills, state-
run Korean Central News Agency reported yesterday. It also
threatened “all-out war” if there is an attack during annual
U.S.-South Korean military drills that began today.  South Korea has dropped leaflets that detail pro-democracy
revolts in the Middle East and argue that “a dictatorial regime
is destined to collapse.” North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il  is
grappling with food shortages and trade sanctions that are
stifling the economy at the same time as he seeks to lay the
foundations for a succession of power to his youngest son.  “North Korea is most fundamentally sensitive to what’s
happening in the Middle East,” Kim Yong Hyun, a professor of
North Korean studies at Seoul-based  Dongguk University  said by
telephone. “South Korea’s psychological warfare at this point
could be pretty burdensome for the North.”  The cost of insuring five-year South Korean government debt
jumped 17 percent on Nov. 23 and the currency weakened after
North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, the first bombardment of
the South’s soil since the 1950-1953  Korean War . The attack,
which killed two soldiers and two civilians, was in retaliation
for South Korean live-firing exercises that breached the North’s
territory, KCNA said at the time.  Facing Off  South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin has pledged to
use all military means, including air strikes, if the North
attacks again. The two countries are technically still at war,
facing off across the world’s most heavily armed border.  The first talks between the two Koreas since the shelling
ended without an agreement on Feb. 10.  North Korea’s million-person army remains capable of
inflicting “catastrophic destruction” through hundreds of
missiles aimed at  Seoul , according to the U.S. military. Under
the North’s “military first” policy, Kim maintained loyalty by
diverting resources to the armed forces.  Shortages may have reached the point where even the
military is beginning to suffer,  Free North Korea Radio  reported
last week. Korea has been collecting ammunition from its
soldiers to preempt possible revolt amid growing animosity
toward the leadership, the Seoul-based defector group reported,
citing a person it didn’t identify.  Growing Anger  Food shortages have led to growing anger toward the North
Korean leadership among soldiers and an increasing number of
deserters, the report cited the person as saying. The station is
run by North Korean defectors in Seoul who say they are in
contact with people in the North. The information it provides
cannot be verified.  The North recently set up a special police squad to stamp
out unrest,  South Korea ’s Dong A Ilbo newspaper reported last
week, citing Daily NK, another Seoul-based group that opposes
Kim’s regime. Tens of North Koreans rallied to demand rice and
electricity on Feb. 14, the Chosun Ilbo paper reported, citing a
source in the country.  Rice prices at markets in Pyongyang have surged since North
Korea revalued its currency at the end of 2009 to curb
inflation, according to data collected by  Daily NK .  North Korea continued to face food shortages even after a
“relatively good harvest” because the government planned to
buy less grain than needed, a situation affecting about 5
million people in the country the United Nation’s Food and
Agricultural Organization said in November.  Fund Flow  Sanctions aimed at forcing North Korea to abandon its
nuclear weapons program are cutting off the flow of funds to
Kim’s regime. North Korea’s $22 billion economy shrank 0.9
percent in 2009 after trade fell 10.7 percent, according to the  Bank of Korea  in Seoul. North Korea doesn’t release figures.  There is a “serious” imbalance between global food
production of grain and demand, KCNA reported on Feb. 21, citing
analysts. A week earlier, it said abnormal weather was boosting
grain prices. KCNA said on Feb. 24 that U.S. use of corn to
produce fuel is decried globally for “its criminal nature and
danger” as it raises food prices.  Scattering leaflets is an “unpardonable crime” to
undermine the regime’s socialist system, KCNA said.  The leaflets tell North Koreans of uprisings that toppled  Egypt ’s government and sparked a revolt in  Libya  that resulted
in a United Nations Security Council demand for a war crimes
investigation into the regime of  Muammar Qaddafi .  The leaflets travel in balloons that distribute their cargo
when they burst, Song Yong Sun, a member of South Korea’s
National Assembly’s defense committee, said in an e-mailed
statement on Feb. 25. South  Korea  has sent more than 3 million
leaflets across the border in renewed “psychological warfare”
since the North’s shelling of Yeonpyeong, the statement said.  KCNA hasn’t reported on demonstrations in the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
