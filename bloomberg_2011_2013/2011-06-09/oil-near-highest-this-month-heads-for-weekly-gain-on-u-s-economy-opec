Oil traded near the highest this
month in  New York , heading for the biggest weekly gain in four
weeks, after the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed and
OPEC’s secretary-general said the group’s production quota
system has been weakened.  Futures were little changed after the U.S. Commerce
Department said record exports in April helped the trade gap
shrink 6.7 percent to $43.7 billion, the lowest since December.
A separate report showed jobless claims unexpectedly rose. The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on June 8 was
unable to reach an accord on targets for the first time in at
least 20 years.  “It’s a complex trading pattern at the moment and the
market will be quite happy to take it higher if they see good
economic grounds,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted crude
will average $100 a barrel this year. “The bulls and bears are
firmly entrenched in a tug-of-war.”  Crude for July delivery was at $101.87 a barrel, down 6
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:03 p.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday rose $1.19 to
$101.93, the highest settlement since May 31. Prices are up 1.6
percent this week and 35 percent higher the past year.  Brent crude  for July delivery gained 27 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $119.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The contract yesterday increased $1.72, or 1.5
percent, to $119.57. It was the highest settlement since May 4.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$17.97 a barrel to U.S. futures today. The difference between
front-month contracts in  London  and New York reached a record
$19.54 on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  The U.S. trade deficit shrank as exports rose 1.3 percent,
led by sales of fuel oil, petroleum products and computers, the
Commerce Department said. The report prompted economists at
Morgan Stanley to raise their estimates for second-quarter
growth to an annual rate of 3.1 percent from 2.7 percent.  Crude oil imports declined by $2.42 billion as prices rose.
The U.S. imported 8.41 million barrels per day on average in
April, the fewest since October.  Consumer confidence improved as gasoline prices ebbed, a
separate report showed. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
climbed to minus 45.9 in the period to June 5, the best showing
since the end of April, from the prior week’s minus 47.1.  Stocks Rise  Asian equities rose today, paring the regional benchmark
index’s sixth weekly decline. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
increased 0.6 percent to 133.42 as of 10:45 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
trimming this week’s drop to 0.4 percent. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index climbed for the first time in seven days, gaining 0.7
percent to 1,289.  U.S. jobless claims rose by 1,000 to 427,000 last week,
Labor Department figures showed yesterday. The number of people
on unemployment benefit rolls and those receiving extended
payments decreased.  OPEC’s quota system has been weakened by the need to
replace lost oil from Libya, the group’s secretary general said
after this week’s divided meeting. “I don’t want to say it is
dead,” Abdalla el-Badri said yesterday in Vienna, referring to
the group’s overall production target. “It is there, but we
have to see how to replace  Libya .”  A rebellion against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has cut
production in the North African country by almost 90 percent,
according to Bloomberg estimates. Output slumped to 200,000
barrels a day last month, from an average of 1.55 million last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s biggest producer,  Kuwait , Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates were ready to supply more oil to the
market, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said after the meeting.
The four nations proposed a 1.5 million-barrel-a-day increase.  Libya, Angola, Ecuador, Algeria,  Iran  and  Venezuela  were
opposed to higher limits, according to al-Naimi.  Iraq  is exempt
from the targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
