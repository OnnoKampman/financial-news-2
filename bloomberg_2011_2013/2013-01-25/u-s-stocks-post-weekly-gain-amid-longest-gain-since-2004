Average  gained 246.28 points, or 1.8 percent, to 13,895.98. Both
measures are trading at the highest levels since 2007.  “People are jumping on the bandwagon,” said Wayne Lin, a
 fund manager  at Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc. His firm
oversees $648 billion. “The earnings are better. Economic
figures are trending the right way. The legislators and the

companies which reported results so far have topped analysts’
estimates. Claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped to a

and health-care companies have led the rally, adding at least
7.2 percent. The benchmark gauge is  trading  at 14.9 times
reported earnings, below the average since 1954 of 16.5.  “The trend favors the march of the bulls,” said Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $212 billion as chief portfolio
strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls,
 Wisconsin . “If we continue to see economic improvement and
financial conditions thaw, we’ll see markets marching higher.”  Measures of consumer discretionary and financial shares

3.1 percent to a record. The Chicago Board Options Exchange
