Crude oil , gasoline and heating oil
tumbled in  New York  after the International Energy Agency said
its members would release crude from strategic reserves. Ethanol
also declined.  The agency announced the release of 2 million barrels a day
for 30 days beginning next week to help make up for a Libyan
supply disruption. Half the amount will come from the U.S.
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the IEA and the U.S.
Energy Department.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for August delivery fell $4.39, or 4.6 percent,
to $91.02 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , below
the 2010 year-end price of $91.38. Futures have risen 19 percent
in the past year. It was the lowest settlement price for the
front-month contract in four months.  “The big driver is the IEA number,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
“There’s been a constant string of negative news about the
economy and a lack of direction from  Washington , which makes for
a very volatile market.”  Gasoline  Gasoline for July delivery dropped 13.57 cents, or 4.6
percent, to settle at $2.8376 a gallon on the Nymex. Gasoline
has declined 9.9 percent in June and increased 36 percent in the
past year.  Regular retail gasoline declined 1.4 cents to $3.612 a
gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. That was the lowest
price since March 30.  Heating Oil  Heating oil for July delivery slid 17.32 cents, or 5.9
percent, to $2.7817 a gallon. Heating oil has declined 9 percent
this month and gained 34 percent in the past year.  Ethanol  Denatured ethanol for July delivery declined 1.1 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $2.647 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Ethanol has increased 69 percent in the past year.  Refineries and Transport  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  restarted a boiler yesterday at its Anacortes,
Washington, refinery that was shut June 16, according to a
notice filed with air regulators.  Frontier Oil Corp. (FTO)  returned a unit to service yesterday at
its El Dorado refinery in Kansas, according to a filing with the
National Response Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
