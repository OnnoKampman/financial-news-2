The following is the text of the
Federal Reserve Board’s Tenth District--  Kansas City .  TENTH DISTRICT - KANSAS CITY  The Tenth District economy expanded at slightly slower pace in
late August and September compared to earlier in the summer.
Consumer spending slowed somewhat, manufacturing growth was more
subdued, and transportation firms reported flat conditions.
Growth in commercial real estate activity slowed marginally, but
remained on a positive trend. Residential sales and construction
continued to grow at a solid pace. Drought conditions hurt
agricultural production, though farm incomes were generally
healthy due to higher crop prices and insurance programs. Energy
activity remained solid, and bankers noted steady loan demand,
better loan quality, and increased deposits. Prices rose
moderately, but wage pressures were contained outside of a few
skilled positions.  Consumer Spending . Consumer spending slowed modestly and
contacts were less optimistic about future sales in the months
ahead. Retail sales declined slightly from the previous survey,
but remained above year-ago levels. Several contacts cited
political uncertainty and rising gasoline prices as key reasons
for the slowdown. Expectations for future sales also eased
somewhat, while store inventories were largely unchanged. Growth
in auto sales was less robust than previous months, and
expectations for future sales weakened slightly. However,
several auto dealers in  Oklahoma  noted higher sales due to
strong energy activity in their areas. Contacts said sales were
strongest for mid-sized family sedans and crossover SUVs, while
sales of full-size trucks and SUVs remained weak. Auto
inventories increased and most dealers anticipated levels to
increase further. Restaurant sales slowed markedly and
expectations also fell. Some contacts noted higher food costs,
rising gasoline prices, and overall consumer uncertainty as
reasons for the decline. Tourist activity edged lower, slightly
more than the usual seasonal slowing, and most contacts expected
further decreases in the months ahead.  Manufacturing and Other Business Activity. Manufacturing
activity in the Tenth District continued to expand, although at
a slower pace than in previous months. Factory orders and
shipments declined, while future hiring plans generally remained
positive. Machinery production fell considerably since the last
survey, with some contacts citing European weakness and
political uncertainty as key reasons for the slowdown. In
contrast, metals and transportation production remained solid.
Manufacturers’  capital spending  plans moderated somewhat, but
firms still indicated overall plans for expansion.
Transportation activity was flat, although several firms
reported higher shipments of perishable food products and more
firms reported an increase in capital spending plans.
Expectations for future transportation activity eased slightly
from the previous survey. Sales growth among high-tech firms
remained somewhat sluggish, with several firms citing political
uncertainty as a contributing factor. However, expectations for
future activity were more positive, and capital spending plans
were generally favorable.  Real Estate and Construction. Solid growth in residential real
estate activity continued in late August and September, while
expansion of commercial real estate activity slowed somewhat.
Housing starts edged higher, and limited availability of workers
was reported as an issue for some builders in states with low
unemployment rates. Expectations for future homebuilding
remained favorable, and building materials were generally
available. Despite the improvement in housing starts, sales at
construction supply firms were considerably slower, and many
businesses were pessimistic about future sales. Home sales
continued to grow at a solid pace, though slightly slower than
in the previous survey. Residential realtors said mid-range
homes sold well, while the luxury home market was still
exceedingly slow. Several contacts noted a rise in sales to
investors, as higher rental rates have increased profit
potential. Expectations for future home sales flattened
somewhat, but prices were generally rising and expected to
increase further. Mortgage lending activity eased slightly, and
one contact noted continued tightening of underwriting
guidelines. Growth in commercial real estate activity slowed
marginally from the previous survey, but was generally solid
overall and most contacts remained optimistic about future
months. Vacancy rates continued to fall, but absorption rates
flattened out. Office prices and rents were also flat from the
previous survey, although some increases were anticipated in
coming months.  Banking. In the recent survey period, bankers generally reported
steady to stronger loan demand, improved loan quality, and
increased deposits. Overall loan demand was favorable as most
respondents reported stable demand for commercial real estate
and consumer installment loans, while demand for residential
real estate and commercial and industrial loans edged slightly
higher. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major
loan categories. The majority of bankers reported improved loan
quality compared to a year ago, and nearly all banks expected
the outlook for loan quality over the next six months to be the
same or better. More institutions reported stronger deposit
volume than in the previous survey.  Energy. Energy activity remained solid in late August and
September. Contacts continued to report reduced activity related
to natural gas exploration, but oil rig counts remained strong
and were expected to stay relatively stable. Natural  gas prices 
remained very low, although several contacts anticipated a
slight increase in prices due to lower levels of exploration and
winter supply concerns. Crude  oil prices  climbed higher from the
previous survey period, which several contacts attributed to
continued Middle East conflict concerns. One producer noted an
increase in service activity particularly in  Wyoming  and  North
Dakota , but contacts reported minimal shortages in equipment and
labor.  Agriculture. Drought continued to hurt agricultural conditions
across the District. Dry, hot weather accelerated crop maturity,
prompting an early corn harvest with below-average yields. The
soybean crop was rated in mostly poor condition as harvest
began. Winter wheat planting was progressing normally, but low
soil moisture could delay emergence. Corn and soybean prices
fell seasonally, but concerns about global production
underpinned wheat prices. Despite drought conditions, high crop
prices and crop insurance payments were expected to boost farm
income and more than offset lower livestock profits due to
higher feed costs. District bankers indicated ample funds were
available for qualified borrowers to meet cash flow needs and
finance carry-over debt. Demand for farm loans remained modest
amidst a pull-back in capital spending. Farmland values rose
further and were expected to remain at high levels.  Wages and Prices. The majority of prices continued to rise
moderately with further increases expected, but wage pressures
were mostly contained outside of a few skilled positions. Retail
prices edged higher, and were anticipated to rise further in
coming months. Prices of manufacturing materials continued to
increase, although fewer firms planned on raising selling
prices. Construction materials prices also moved higher,
particularly for oil-related products such as shingles.
Transportation firms reported higher input prices, and increased
food costs continued to impact profit margins and selling prices
for restaurants. Many contacts noted that rising gasoline prices
have increased input costs and cut sales volumes. Wage pressures
were still generally contained in most industries, although some
firms reported continued difficulties in obtaining skilled
labor, such as truck drivers, construction workers, software
programmers, and engineers.  SOURCE:  Federal Reserve Board
