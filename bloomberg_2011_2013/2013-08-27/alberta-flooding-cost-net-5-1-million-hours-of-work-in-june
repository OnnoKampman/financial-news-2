Flooding in  Alberta  in June led to a
net loss of 5.1 million hours of work, Statistics  Canada  said
today.  About 300,000 Albertans, or 13.5 percent of people employed
in the province, lost 7.5 million hours of work because of
floods during the second half of June, the statistics agency
said. That was partly offset by 134,000 people who worked an
additional 2.4 million hours.  In its July Monetary Policy  Report , the  Bank of Canada 
forecast that the flooding would curtail economic growth by an
annualized 0.7 percentage point in the second quarter, and would
raise growth by 1 percentage point in the third quarter because
of repair and reconstruction projects.  The 5.1 million hours worked represents about 1 percent of
total hours worked in a week in Canada, according to Bloomberg
calculations using  Statistics Canada  data.  The statistics agency’s labor force  report  for June didn’t
take the flooding into account because the reference period for
the survey was June 9 to June 15. That report showed employment
was little changed during the month.  Last June’s floods forced the evacuation of as many as
75,000 people from their homes in Calgary, about 7 percent of
the city’s population. Parts of Calgary, with more corporate
headquarters than any other Canadian city except Toronto, were
under water after the Bow and Elbow rivers swelled from record
rainfall in the nearby  Rocky Mountains  and spilled into low-lying communities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
