Wheat slid for a fourth session in
five in Chicago on speculation rain from  Russia  to Australia may
boost global harvests. Corn fell and soybeans advanced.  Areas of western Russia and northern Kazakhstan will have
showers and cooling temperatures this week, easing stress on
developing crops, Telvent DTN said today in a report. Between 10
millimeters (0.4 inch) and 50 millimeters fell in Australia’s
eastern grain-growing regions in the week ended May 28,
according to the nation’s  Bureau  of Meteorology.  “Recent rainfall in southern Russia and eastern Australia
has helped ease wheat-production worries,”  Luke Mathews , a
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote in a note
today. Russia’s harvest begins in July, while Australian crops
will be collected starting in October.  Wheat for July delivery fell 1.3 percent to $6.715 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 1:23 p.m. London time. The
most-active contract is up 2.6 percent this month and 2.9
percent in 2012. Markets were shut yesterday for the Memorial
Day holiday.  In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat declined 1.3
percent to 213.25 euros ($267.18) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Australia is projected to be the world’s second-largest
wheat exporter in the 2012-13 season and Russia will rank
fourth, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Ukraine and Russia, accounting for 11 percent of world
output in 2011-12, have endured  drought  conditions for three
months, University College London data show. In the U.S., rain
has been below normal from Texas to  Ohio  in the past 14 days, QT
Weather said in a report yesterday.  Wheat demand from feed users may exceed the USDA’s 180
million-bushel estimate for the year ending May 31, as the grain
remains at a discount to corn in the Midwest, Morgan Stanley
analyst  Hussein Allidina  wrote in a report e-mailed today.  July-delivery corn fell 0.3 percent to $5.7675 a bushel in
Chicago. The grain has slid 9.1 percent this month, headed for a
third decline, and is down 11 percent this year.  Soybeans for July delivery gained 0.7 percent to $13.91 a
bushel. The oilseed, down 7.6 percent in May, is still up 15
percent this year after dry weather hurt South American crops.  To contact the reporters on this story:
